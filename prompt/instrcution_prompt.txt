Here are the requirements:
1. Ensure that all tasks are related to the medical domain.
2. Craft tasks that encompass varied points of view, e.g. experts, students and patients, etc.
3. Maximize the range of task topics, e.g. diseases, treatment, diagnoses, epidemiology, pharmacology, pathophysiology, anatomy, genetics, medical education, etc.
4. Introduce different task formats, e.g. text generation, open Q&A, chat, rewrites, summarizations, classifications, USMLE style Q&A, multiple-choice Q&A, single-hop reasoning and multiple-hop reasoning etc.
5. All the formats specified in point 4 MUST be represented in the task you generate.
6. Create tasks with medical difficulty levels from 1 to 5, with 1 being the easiest and 5 the hardest.
7. Use diverse language in the instructions. For instance, combine questions with imperative forms.
8. Some instructions might require specific inputs. If an input is not necessary, such as with general instructions like "What are the side effects of COVID-19?", use "<noinput>" in the input field.
9. When provided, inputs must range between 50 to 200 words and offer detailed medical context , e.g. symptom descriptions, radiology reports, clinical notes, and exam questions, etc. 
10. Generate a detailed and comprehensive input instead ask user-provided input.
11. Ensure USMLE style Q&A and multiple-choice Q&A tasks have both question and choices in input, and the question context should be detailed.
12. The USMLE-style question length must exceed 50 words.
13. Match instruction and input to the task's perspective. Patient perspectives should be simple and in first person, while clinician views should have professional terminology.
14. Ensure the lengths of inputs for different tasks are notably distinct.
15. Each task should adhere to the following structure: 'Type: \n, Topic: \n, View: \n, Difficulty: \n, Instruction: \n, Input: '. Start each new task with '###'.
