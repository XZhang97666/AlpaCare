It was swollen and now it has shrunk to almost half the size of the other one. As I am sexually active, I feel a pain in each of the vas deferens after sex. If I do not have sex for days, they become sensitive. I was treated with Ceftum 500 mg, the first time I had an infection. Now my question is, is there any chance that the infection is still in my body? And, do I need to get examined for it? For the time being, please suggest some precautionary antibiotics for my relief.", "output": "I'm sorry to hear you're experiencing these symptoms. Your description suggests that you might have had orchitis, which is inflammation of one or both testes and common in people who get mumps after puberty. Orchitis can indeed result in a decrease in testicle size and potential fertility issues.\n\nWhile it's difficult to definitely say without an examination, the persistence of your symptoms does indicate there may be ongoing issues or complications like chronic epididymitis (inflammation of the tube at the back of the testicle).\n\nIt is essential for you to see a urologist as soon as possible for further evaluation and management. They can perform ultrasound imaging studies or other tests to confirm the diagnosis and plan treatment. Avoiding sexual activity till you visit and receive advice from the doctor would also be prudent.\n\nAs for antibiotics, it's best not to self-medicate as this requires a prescription based on a thorough assessment of infection type, severity and your overall health status. An inappropriate antibiotic usage could lead to resistance and make any lingering infection more difficult to treat.\n\nPlease schedule an appointment with a healthcare provider or urologist immediately to address these concerns."}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.", "output": "Cocaine generally leaves the body within a few days. It is normally not detectable in blood or saliva tests after 1 to 2 days, and in urine tests it can be detected up to 3 days, but this can extend to about two weeks with heavy use. The half-life of cocaine is relatively short, about 0.5 to 1.5 hours.\n\nIn terms of impact on sperm, cocaine has been found to cause abnormalities in sperm shape, number, and movement, which could potentially affect fertility. There isn't a specific time frame linked to how long cocaine stays in sperm, as such effects depend on individual metabolism and frequency of use.\n\nWhile there aren't definitive guidelines for this situation, it's generally recommended for couples trying to conceive to avoid illicit drugs altogether, because of potential harm to both prospective parents and the potential child. It is advisable to seek further advice from your own healthcare provider who knows your personal circumstances.\n\nIt's also important to consider lifestyle choices that promote healthy fertility. Maintaining a healthy weight, eating a balanced diet, getting regular physical activity, and abstaining from alcohol, tobacco and other harmful substances can all help improve fertility outcomes.\n\nYou should share this information with your healthcare provider so they can provide you with accurate guidance based on their knowledge of your overall health condition.\n"}

Nothing hurts or is sore, I just want to know how long I am going to have the brown discharge and if I should be worried or if I should do anything about it?", "output": "It sounds like you're experiencing breakthrough bleeding, which can occur when the hormonal levels in your body fluctuate. When on oral contraceptives like Yaz, skipping sugar pills and prolonging the time before having a period can potentially lead to irregularities including breakthrough bleeding or spotting.\n\nThe brown discharge is likely old blood that didn't fully exit during your period. If it doesn't clear up within a few days to a week, or if you notice other symptoms like an unusual vaginal odor, itchiness, burning sensation, or pelvic pain, contact your healthcare provider as there could be another issue, such as infection or inflammation.\n\nAs for the bleeding during sex, this could also be related to breakthrough bleeding or might indicate cervical irritation. It should subside with your next menstrual cycle. Still, recurrent or heavy bleeding during sex warrants medical attention to rule out more serious conditions like polyps, infection, or rarely, cervical cancer.\n\nIf these conditions persist or cause concern, it would be best to consult with your healthcare provider who might want to adjust your contraceptive regimen or investigate other causes behind these symptoms. \n\nKeep in mind, this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific causes may not apply to your situation. Always consult with your doctor for appropriate examinations, treatment, testing, and care recommendations."}

Can you suggest me what should I do?", "output": "Your son has a high degree of myopia (nearsightedness), which means he can see things clearly that are close, but things in the distance will look blurred. This condition is fairly common and manageable with corrective measures like glasses or contact lenses. Some precautions and steps you can take include:\n\n1. Regular Eye Check-ups: Ensure he gets regular eye checkups so that any worsening of his myopia can be detected early.\n\n2. Corrective Lenses: Be consistent with use of prescribed eyeglasses or contact lenses. Take care to replace them as advised by the optometrist if your son's prescription changes.\n\n3. Monitor Screen Time: Limit the time spent on digital devices given that excessive screen time can strain eyes and contribute to progressive myopia. Encourage him to take frequent breaks using the 20-20-20 rule. Every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds.\n\n4. Encourage Outdoor Activities: Increase outdoor activities, as studies have indicated they could slow down the progression of myopia.\n\n5. Good Lighting: Make sure he always reads and writes under good light conditions to limit the strain on his eyes. \n\n6. Healthy Diet: Nurture a balanced diet rich in fruits and vegetables, which are beneficial for eye health.\n\n7.

Currently taking Amoxicillin 500 mg and Ibuprofen 600 mg. Please let me know what this hard lump is, also generally on the lower side where this lump is, remains sore.", "output": "The lump you are describing could be due to several reasons:\n\n1. Postoperative Swelling: After an extraction or a surgical procedure, swelling of the surrounding tissues is common and can sometimes feel like a hard lump. This should subside as the healing progresses.\n \n2. Abscess/Infection: Although not as common since you're already taking Amoxicillin, which is an antibiotic, it's possible that there could have been an infection forming around the extraction site causing this lumpy feel.\n\n3. Bone Spurring: Sometimes after extractions, small sharp pieces of bone can push their way out from the extraction site. These are usually normal, but can feel like a hard lump until they either come fully out or resorb into the body.\n\nGiven that the lower wisdom tooth was removed only six days ago, swelling in the area is still quite normal, especially if the procedure was complex due to the close proximity to the nerve. However, if the swelling doesn't subside, becomes notably worse, or if you develop other signs of infection like fever or intense pain, it is very important to contact your surgeon right away.\n\nAs always, although these are general guidelines, nothing beats a physical examination in person. Therefore, I would advise you to discuss your concern with your oral surgeon. Ensure to maintain good oral hygiene and follow all post-operative instructions given by your dentist.

It's good that you've been testing regularly and currently have negative results.\n\nThe little red spots on your fingers may not necessarily be related to HIV. They could be caused by many things like dermatitis, eczema, psoriasis, allergies, or even stress. However, it would be difficult for me to confirm without physically seeing them. You should consult with a dermatologist if these dots persist or develop further symptoms.\n\nCold and throat infection can also come from common viruses and not necessarily linked to HIV. If tested negative multiple times within the three-month window period, it is very likely you are HIV-negative. Current tests are extremely accurate at this point.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that few type of HIV tests will need six months time to detect antibodies.

Tiny 3 mm RLL nodule noted. No enlarged lymph nodes. Mild thymic hyperplasia. The partly visualized upper abdominal viscera appear unremarkable. No aggressive bony lesion. They said I do not need to do anything which is strange because there are two nodes now and the second one was not there six months ago. Do I need some kind of medicine therapy to clear my lung from this node or do I need to check if it is growing or not after one year?", "output": "Based on the results of your CT scan, it seems like your situation is under control. The small size of these nodules (3 mm and 4 mm), as well as their non-aggressive appearance on imaging, strongly suggest they are benign (non-cancerous). Intrathoracic nodules, such as intrapulmonary lymph nodes or lung nodules, can appear for many reasons other than cancer, including infection, inflammation, or even normal anatomic variations.\n\nThe finding of \"mild thymic hyperplasia\" also suggests a non-malignant process; the thymus sometimes enlarges in response to stress, illness, or normal hormonal changes depending on age.\n\nWhile it's completely understandable that you might find this concerning, at this stage, the appropriate course of action usually involves monitoring rather than aggressive treatment. This would typically involve follow-up CT scans at intervals recommended by a radiologist or pulmonologist to ensure there's no significant growth or change in these nodules.\n\nHowever, remember, this advice is based on limited information and should not replace the advice of your own physicians who have full access to your medical records.

Please advice for any side effect.", "output": "Phenol, also known as carbolic acid, is a corrosive substance which can cause harm if ingested or in contact with skin. Based on the symptoms your friend has shown (vomiting), it indicates that phenol could have affected his gastrointestinal tract.\n\nContinued symptoms to watch for would include abdominal pain, diarrhea, burns or blisters around the mouth, difficulty swallowing/breathing, dizziness/fainting, and changes in heart rate. Skin exposure can also result in burns, so clean any areas that might've come into contact with phenol with mild soap and water.\n\nThe actions taken so far (vomiting and drinking lots of salty water) in an attempt to mitigate the effects are not recommended without medical supervision since they bring about their own potential risks such as dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. \n\nAt this point due to the potential severity of phenol poisoning, I highly recommend seeking immediate emergency medical attention even though he vomited after ingestion.

I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia last year. I am looking for some answers and some help.", "output": "Ferritin is a protein that stores iron in your body, and the ferritin test measures the amount of ferritin in your blood. Normally, as you stated, high ferritin levels can indicate conditions where your body stores too much iron. Hemochromatosis is one such condition, but you mention being tested for this with negative results.\n\nElevated ferritin levels can also occur due to inflammation, liver disease, malignant diseases, or other chronic disorders. Since you are diagnosed with fibromyalgia - which is a long-term condition that causes pain all over the body - this could be contributing to your elevated ferritin levels. \n\nHowever, only your healthcare provider who understands your history and clinical profile will be able to piece together these puzzle pieces. Moreover, ferritin can increase depending upon lifestyle factors too like alcohol intake, diet, physical activity levels, etc.\n\nAlso, mildly elevated glucose levels might indicate impaired fasting glucose (pre-diabetes).

That being said, it is still important to treat BV.\n\nIf standard treatments like Metronidazole or Clindamycin are not working for you, you should certainly revisit your doctor who may explore other treatment options. Refractory BV sometimes requires long-term or recurrent treatments. Don't hesitate to include natural alternatives under supervision, such as probiotics which have been shown to help reestablish healthy vaginal flora.\n\nAdditionally, maintaining excellent genital hygiene might be helpful \u2013 clean your external genital area gently with mild unscented soap, avoid douching, avoid irritants like bubble baths, sprays etc., and ensure underwear are always clean and dry.\n\nYou should also get regularly tested for STIs since having BV may increase your susceptibility to them.

I would recommend seeing a dermatologist for an examination if you have not had one recently so that they may confirm exactly what is going on. They may want to perform an allergy test and may also check your liver and kidney function with blood tests as diseases of these organs can sometimes manifest this way. It's important to explore other possibilities such as other types of dermatitis, scabies, thyroid issues, among others. If possible, take note of what seems to trigger the itching and how long it lasts which could provide clues about its source.\n\nRemember, only use medications based on doctor advice and apply a hypoallergenic moisturizer to your skin immediately after getting out of the bath while your skin is still damp.

The safety and efficacy of this medication largely depend on the gestational age, the dose, and how it's administrated.\n\nSide effects can include heavy bleeding, pelvic pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea among others. While complications are rare, they do exist and can be life-threatening including severe bleeding or infection. \n\nFurthermore, Mifepristone's effectiveness rate is not 100%. On its own, mifepristone is less effective; thus, it is usually given in combine with misoprostol. Together, they are about 95 - 98% effective when administered correctly up until the 10th week of pregnancy.\n\nMoreover, in many countries, Mifepristone and other drugs that induce abortion are typically regulated medicines, which means they must be prescribed by a licensed healthcare provider after determining that the use of these medications is safe and appropriate for the individual patient's situation.\n\nLastly, I want to emphasize that using this type of medication without consulting her doctor first can lead to significant health risks. Your best option is to consult with your family doctor or gynecologist who can guide you with safe methods taking into account your wife's general health and specific condition.\n\n"}

She also has pain in her knees bilaterally, which has been attributed to osteoarthritis. She also complains of hip pain associated with swelling and difficulty in standing, lying and changing sides while sleeping. There is episodic stiffness present in the shoulders, which causes some discomfort in raising arms above the shoulder level. She is taking Bisoprolol 5 mg and Amlodipine 5 mg for high BP and it is well-controlled. She has no history of any allergy. She has kidney stones and so occasional pain in the lumbar area. She used to get constipation frequently. She was hospitalized four times for normal vaginal deliveries and once for abortion. She is monogamous with her husband. She has a positive family history of hypertension in mother, CAD in father, mother and brother and uterine cancer in mother.

She sleeps 4 to 6 hours daily and snores at night.", "output": "Based on your description, it seems like your mother is experiencing a multitude of symptoms. The sudden loss of weight bearing ability in the left Achilles tendon indicating some weakness or potential damage which can result from inadequate blood flow, nerve damage or inflammation from diseases such as arthritis and potentially an effects of age.\n\nThe knee and hip pain with swelling could be due to her osteoarthritis or possibly other form of arthritis. Difficulty in movement further indicates this condition causing joint stiffness and immobility.\n\nHer hypertension is reportedly controlled, but she should continue taking her prescribed medication (Bisoprolol and Amlodipine). The kidney stones may be a cause of her lumbar area pain; depending on the size and location of the stones, treatment options may vary.\n\nThe occasional constipation could be related to her diet or potentially certain medications.\n\nYour mother's gynecological history suggests hormonal fluctuations especially with irregular menstrual cycles. This requires close monitoring considering the family's history of uterine cancer.\n\nFor her sleep pattern, if there are signs of distress like difficulty breathing or momentary stops in breathing during snoring, they might suggest presence of conditions like sleep apnea, which would need evaluation.\n\nGiven this complex health scenario, I recommend having a detailed consultation with your mother's primary care provider who can guide you for specialist consultations if required. Please make sure she continues her current medications, maintains adequate hydration and follows a balanced diet. She should also get regular exercise as tolerated considering her joint issues.\n"}

I changed the type of PPI three times but the symptoms persisted. The symptoms included a feeling of pressure above my right ear and behind my right eye. Later, I came off the PPIs and after using over the counter headache painkillers for three days the severity of the headaches eased. But the feeling of pressure remains to this day on the right side of the face. I often feel heavy head or even light-headed with a slight dizziness, often as if I am hung over. The symptoms come and go, but are there every day for differing periods of time. And the constant is this feeling of slight pressure on the right side of my head above the ear and extending sometimes down to the cheek and behind the right eye.", "output": "The symptoms you're describing are consistent with a condition known as a tension headache. Tension headaches result from muscle contractions in the head and neck region, and they can present as pressure right above your ear and behind your eye. It could possibly be triggered by certain medications including PPIs.\n\nHowever, tension headache is just one possibility. There may be other causes like sinus issues which also present with pressure feeling on face and head. Anxiety and stress can also cause similar symptoms. \n\nSince you mentioned these symptoms persist after stopping the PPIs and also because they seem to come and go every day, I would advise you to consult with a neurologist to ensure that there isn't any serious underlying issue such as migraines, or neuralgia etc. \n\nFor now, try relaxation techniques and avoiding stress as much as possible. Stay hydrated and maintain a regular sleep schedule. Remember, it's crucial to seek professional medical advice for an appropriate diagnosis and treatment.

Can people with trench mouth have no bad breath and is able to eat normal food?", "output": "Trench mouth, also known as acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG), is a severe form of gum disease characterized by painful, infected, bleeding gums and ulcers. Key symptoms often include bad breath (halitosis) and pain upon eating.\n\nHowever, bear in mind that not all individuals with ANUG will necessarily exhibit all symptoms to the same degree. For instance, some people may still be able to eat normally without experiencing significant discomfort, and not everyone with ANUG has noticeably bad breath. \n\nAlso remember that these symptoms are not exclusive to trench mouth; they could indicate other oral health issues too. But regarding your partner's case specifically, if he doesn't have any noticeable symptoms such as painful or bleeding gums, ulcers, or fever, it seems unlikely he has trench mouth. \n\nNonetheless, even without obvious signs, if you suspect there may be a problem, it's best for him to get a check-up with a dentist who can properly diagnose his condition.\n"}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,My son has developed anxiety symptoms about four years ago. They came completely out of the blue. He was with someone who now has heart palpitations, sweaty palms and feet, and lightheadedness sitting in the living room. We ran a battery of tests when it first happened including TSH, EKG, lung scans, blood panels, etc. and everything was normal. So we went down the path of anxiety. Four years later, the symptoms continued. As my son now has a terrible fear of doctors, we tried a home blood test to get a full thyroid panel. I have attached the results.The blood work came back normal. Low normal TSH, but low normal T4 and lower normal free T4 and free T3. There is nothing that shows an abnormality. However, his urine test showed moderately low iodine and slightly low selenium. I have read that abnormalities in these measures could cause thyroid problems. What am I wondering is if these two indicators are worth further exploration with an endocrinologist knowing that going to the doctor will cause my son a severe panic.Also, is it possible that low iodine could have been a temporary diet thing and it is masking the signs of hyperthyroidism in the blood work? He has all of the symptoms of someone with hyperthyroidism. On a side note, I am hypothyroid, my sister is hypothyroid and my two nieces had Hashimoto\\s with my younger niece having thyroid cancer and got her thyroid removed at age of 22. So everyone on my side of the family has thyroid issues. We were wondering if you could please give us some guidance. Looking to see if we need to eliminate thyroid as a possible cause of his symptoms or if it is worth further pursuit.", "output": "Given the persistent symptoms and family history of thyroid conditions, it would be wise to further investigate this with an endocrinologist. Even though his blood work came back normal, it's important to remember that the reference ranges for TSH, free T3, and free T4 are quite broad and values within lower or upper limits of the normal range may not be optimal for everybody.\n\nMoreover, as you've indicated his urine test showed low iodine and selenium levels - both elements which are crucial for proper thyroid functioning. Selenium deficiency alone can promote autoimmunity in the context of genetic predisposition, which is relevant considering your family history. \n\nThe possibility of low iodine due to diet and its effect on masking signs of hyperthyroidism is unlikely. Low iodine intake generally leads to hypothyroidism rather than hyperthyroidism because iodine is required for the synthesis of thyroid hormones. If there was a long-standing severe iodine deficiency, you could potentially see hyperthyroidism when iodine is reintroduced, but this typically happens under very specific circumstances (such as public health efforts to correct severe population-wide iodine deficiency).\n\nSince his fear of doctors might exacerbate existing anxiety, perhaps telehealth visits can help alleviate some of this stress while still providing him necessary medical attention. We should also not overlook the possibility that his symptoms may indeed be panic related, since anxiety disorders can mimic many physical disease processes. Hence, along with endocrine evaluation, psychological assessment could also be considered useful"}

Long-term use of this medication may thin or damage the skin and possibly cause other more serious internal side effects. It's not typically used for acne treatment.\n\nFor treating acne, strategies will depend on the type and severity of your acne, as well as your type of skin. This can involve over-the-counter creams and ointments, prescription drugs, or medical procedures. Hormonal changes, such as those experienced during puberty and menstruation, as well as stress, can stimulate sebum production and thereby potentially exacerbate acne. Masturbation does not scientifically cause acne but stress might.\n\nIt's highly recommended to consult with a dermatologist who can provide advice and may be able to prescribe you with more suitable treatments for acne like benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, retinoids, azelaic acid, or prescription medications like antibiotics.\n\nRemember, don't pick at your acne or wash your face excessively as these actions can actually make conditions worse.

So, please doctor help me and give me a suggestion.", "output": "Based on your symptoms, it appears you may be suffering from dental decay or caries, which is a bacterial infection of teeth. The black discoloration can occur as the result of consumption of certain foods and drinks (like coffee, tea, cola), tobacco use, inadequate brushing and flossing, or due to a buildup of tartar. \n\nHere are few suggestions:\n\n1. Good oral hygiene: Brush your teeth twice daily with fluoride toothpaste and floss once a day.\n2. Cut down on sugar: Sugar feeds the bacteria in your mouth, causing it to produce acids that erode enamel and lead to cavities.\n3. Regular dental check-ups: Visit a dentist every 6 months for professional cleaning and check-up.\n4. Balanced diet: Maintain a healthy, balanced diet and drink plenty of water to keep your mouth hydrated and discourage bacterial growth.\n\nSince your mother also suffers from this issue, there could be a genetic component. Oral health problems can sometimes run in families, so both of you should prioritize good oral care habits and regular dental visits.\n\nBad breath can simply be caused by the food we eat, smoking, dry mouth, medical conditions, gum disease, and sinus conditions.

People are telling me it should be strapped or cast right away. I am worried.", "output": "The choice to treat a fracture with casting, ORIF (open reduction and internal fixation), or buddy taping depends on the location of the fracture, its displacement, instability and involvement of joint. Based on your description, it seems like you have an intra-articular fracture of your fifth metacarpal which is displaced significantly.\n\nGiven these specifics, I understand why you'd be concerned about only having a buddy tape in place instead of a cast or strap. The goal of treatment in these scenarios is often to align the bones so they heal accurately. Buddy taping alone might not provide sufficient realignment and stabilization for a considerably ulnarly-displaced intraarticular fracture. And waiting for the clinic can increase the risk of malunion, where the bone heals incorrectly leading to potential long-term disability, discomfort, and decreased hand functionality. \n\nHowever, without examining you personally or reviewing your images directly, it's difficult for me to give precise advice. What you should do right now is reach out immediately to the medical team already involved in your care. Let them know your pain level, any changes to your symptoms, and your concerns about non-surgical management. It would also be advisable to get a second opinion if possible.\n\nBut regardless, ensure that you're keeping your hand elevated to help reduce swelling, icing it regularly to decrease pain, and avoiding any activities that could further injure the area while you wait."}

I have read that there could be bleeding during pregnancy as well.", "output": "A lack of menstruation can be for a variety of reasons. Dengue fever could, in theory, affect a menstrual cycle due to the body being under stress. The spotting that your fianc\u00e9e experienced could also be related to the disease or its treatment.\n\nThat being said, it is equally possible that pregnancy could be causing these symptoms. Both implantation bleeding (which often occurs around the time of a woman's expected period and can sometimes be mistaken for a lighter-than-usual period) and changes in cervical bleeding can cause light vaginal bleeding in early pregnancy. \n\nOther causes of delayed or missed periods include high levels of stress, significant changes in weight, hormonal imbalances, certain medical conditions, changes in medication etc.\n\nIt is important for your fianc\u00e9e to see a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis if she doesn't get her periods soon and especially if you both have been sexually active with no contraceptive use.

Anxiety can cause physical symptoms, but it wouldn't typically affect eyesight in this way.\n\nWhile it's good that the blurriness seems to subside when looking out of the corner of your eye, that doesn't really give much clinical information about the potential underlying issue. It's important to see an optometrist who can more precisely evaluate your visual acuity, as well as assess any possible medical concerns through a comprehensive eye exam.\n\nThe floaters you mentioned are fairly common and don't always indicate a serious problem. However, if you're seeing a lot of new floaters, or if they're accompanied by flashes of light or peripheral vision loss, then you should seek immediate medical attention as these can be signs of a retinal detachment.\n\nIn the meantime, try not to strain your eyes, take breaks from screens, maintain good lighting when reading or working, and avoid rubbing your eyes.

But this time even after 11 days, there is no withdrawal bleeding. Is this because of hormonal imbalance or pregnancy?", "output": "The emergency contraceptive pill, or \"morning-after pill,\" contains hormones that can prevent pregnancy by delaying ovulation or preventing fertilization. It is common to experience alterations in your menstrual cycle after taking the I-pill due to its hormonal impact. These changes can include spotting, early periods, late periods, or even missed periods.\n\nIt's difficult to say for certain whether the lack of withdrawal bleeding this time around is due to a hormonal imbalance caused by taking two I-pills within a month, or if it could possibly indicate pregnancy. Given that you had protected sex and took an emergency contraceptive, the chances should be relatively low, but no method is 100% effective. \n\nI would recommend doing a home pregnancy test for your peace of mind. If the test comes out negative and you still don't get your period, consider seeing a healthcare professional to discuss your symptoms/condition.

Metoprolol tartrate: This is a beta blocker which is used to lower blood pressure, but also slows down the heart rate and decreases the work on the heart.\n2. Potassium Chloride: This is often prescribed due to the effects other medications like Lasix (Furosemide) can have on lowering potassium levels in the body. Maintaining a healthy potassium level is important for normal heart rhythms.\n3. Losartan potassium: This is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist (ARB) effective at blood vessel dilation and relieving high blood pressure. \n4.

In more severe cases, doctors might consider prescribing H2 blockers or leukotriene antagonists. Corticosteroids could also be used in short courses for extreme flare-ups; however, long-term use is generally avoided due to potential side effects.\n\nIn addition, I'd encourage you to try identify and avoid triggering factors that contribute towards your hives - e.g., heat, certain foods, stress etc. This, along with the right medication, should help you manage your chronic urticaria better.\n"}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,My friend underwent a USG and she was detected with 6-week pregnancy and then she took Mifepristone and then next day four Misoprostol (mouth dissolving). Now it has been more than 24 hours. She is bleeding continuously with clots and having severe pain. Kindly suggest what to do now for pain and bleeding?", "output": "If your friend is experiencing severe pain and consistent bleeding, she should seek immediate medical attention. Medical abortion can lead to some bleeding and discomfort which can be managed usually with over the counter medication but if there is too much of either, it could be a sign of complications such as an incomplete abortion or excessive blood loss. It's very important these symptoms are evaluated by a doctor immediately."}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,I have hydrocele for so many years. But as it is not showing any problem so I left it till now. But now I want to go for hydrocele surgery. Also, I want to know any other methods except surgery which can be done to finish hydrocele. Now I am also going to gym and doing some physical exercise there. Is there any problem with it? My age is 27 years, height is 5\\10\" and weight is 83 kg.", "output": "A hydrocele is a type of swelling in the scrotum that occurs when fluid collects in the thin sheath surrounding a testicle. Hydroceles are usually painless and often don't require treatment. However, if you've decided to opt for surgery, it's generally considered safe and effective.\n\nOptions besides surgery can include watching and waiting or aspiration and sclerotherapy. With monitoring, as long as they aren't causing discomfort, there's not typically any problem with leaving them untreated. Aspiration and sclerotherapy involves drawing out the fluid with a needle and then injecting a chemical into the sac to prevent more fluid from accumulating. It isn't as widely used because it has higher rates of recurrence and complications compared to surgery.\n\nGoing to the gym and working out shouldn't be an issue with having a hydrocele, but certain exercises like those involving heavy weights, might increase intra-abdominal pressure and thus exacerbate the symptoms. So, while light exercises should be fine, do ensure to avoid heavy lifting.\n\nIn all scenarios, I recommend discussing this thoroughly with your healthcare provider who can properly evaluate you and provide advice tailored specifically to your condition."}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,I have protected sex with stranger and after that I get inflammation in urinary tract. Should I get worried about it?", "output": "It's important to understand that even protected sex with a stranger can run the risk of transmitting sexually transmitted infections (STIs), especially if there were any mishaps with the protection used. The inflammation in your urinary tract may be due to an STI or it might just be a simple Urinary Tract Infection (UTI).\n\nThis doesn't mean you should start worrying excessively, but you absolutely do need to seek medical attention as soon as possible. If it is indeed a UTI, these are usually easy to treat with antibiotics. However, if it turns out to be an STI, proper treatment is critical to avoid complications.\n\nIn the meantime, reduce discomfort by drinking plenty of water and avoiding irritants like coffee, alcohol and spicy foods. Also, don't forget to always use protection during sexual activities."}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,I had a back to back unprotected sex with my partner for three days in this month and my expected period date was six days later. I have taken unwanted 72 on the third day morning after having breakfast. But, still, my periods have not yet started. Can you please help me out with the reason behind that?", "output": "Emergency contraceptives like Unwanted 72 can alter your menstrual cycle. This means after taking it, your next period could either start earlier or get delayed. The delay can be up to one week. If it's longer than a week or you have other symptoms (like nausea, breast tenderness), then you should take a pregnancy test to rule out the possibility of pregnancy.\n\nPlease note that emergency contraception pills should only be used as an emergency measure and not as a regular method of contraception. Regular unprotected sex carries risks of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and unplanned pregnancies. Always use protection to maintain good reproductive health. Consult with a healthcare provider for more personalized advice."}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,I was having spotting most of the month, then heavy bleeding for two days. I then passed what looked like grey muscle and suddenly no more blood. What does that mean or what could it be?", "output": "Your symptoms may suggest a variety of gynecological conditions such as endometrial polyps, uterine fibroids, hormonal imbalances or potentially a miscarriage (if there's a chance you could have been pregnant). The passing of grey tissue could possibly be the lining of the uterus that has shed (endometrium) if it was not a miscarriage. This should not be taken lightly and I highly recommend seeing a healthcare provider soon in order to get an accurate diagnosis. They can guide you through any necessary tests such as blood tests, ultrasounds or other appropriate examinations based on their clinical judgement."}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hi doctor,My son is six years old. He has nasal blockage for the past two weeks. Now, he has developed a fever. His throat and tonsils are swollen. We took him to a doctor. The doctor prescribed him Benadryl 5 ml and Crocin DS 7.5 ml. He has not given any antibiotics. Is it fine? Please suggest.", "output": "The doctor's prescription of Benadryl and Crocin DS seems appropriate at this stage. Benadryl will help with his nasal blockage as it is a decongestant, and Crocin DS (which contains paracetamol) will help to reduce his fever.\n\nHowever, the persistence of symptoms for two weeks and the present swollen tonsils might indeed suggest a bacterial infection like strep throat, which would typically need an antibiotic for treatment. Sometimes, clinicians wait for symptoms to persist beyond a certain point before starting antibiotics.\n\nNevertheless, if your son's condition doesn't improve or worsens after few days of administering these medicines, I advise you revisit your pediatrician. They may reassess the situation and consider starting antibiotics if necessary. Also, make sure your kid rests and gets plenty of fluids."}

It has not cleared up in the past half an hour. Twice over the years, this has happened, and it normalized over a few hours, but I am in a jungle now. So, I would like to err on the side of caution. I have had previous retinal detachments.", "output": "Sudden blurred vision in one eye could be a serious medical emergency considering your history of retinal detachments. Though it has resolved on its own in the past, you shouldn\u2019t rely on this happening again. The symptoms can indicate various conditions from less dangerous like dry eyes or refractive errors to potentially more severe conditions such as optic neuritis, macular degeneration, but in your case, it might signal a retinal detachment which is a significant concern and needs an immediate evaluation by an eye specialist.\n\nWithout having proper tools and clinical examination at hand I advise you to protect your vision by lowering physical activity, avoid bending down and certainly no heavy lifting. Keep your head up, at heart level generally. Do not rub your eyes too. \n\nI would strongly advise that you seek urgent professional medical assistance as soon as possible if you are able to leave the jungle or perhaps there's any possibility of communicating with services that may assist you in reaching a hospital urgently. It should not be taken lightly given your medical history and current context."}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,Last night, I fell from my bike on my right side as it got slipped while driving. My right hand and right shoulder directly hit the road and cause severe pain on the right side of the abdomen. A local doctor prescribed some medicine and I got relieved from my side pain. I went for an x-ray of the right chest, it was normal. But after 36 hours I am having pain in the right shoulder (scapula) and while sitting, or arising out of bed, or moving hand on the upper side the pain increases a lot. Is it normal or need better medical assistance?", "output": "Pain after a fall like yours is certainly not unusual. You may have bruised or strained the muscles and tissues around your right shoulder and scapula, which would explain the pain you're feeling, especially when moving in certain ways. \n\nHowever, given that the pain appears to be worsening or at least persisting after 36 hours, it's prudent to seek further medical evaluation. This could signify something more serious, such as a fracture which might not have been apparent on an X-ray at first due to swelling or inflammation, or a rotator cuff injury which would require specific physical therapy or possibly surgery.\n\nEven if there is no major damage, seeing a doctor could provide peace of mind and possible pain relief strategies such as physiotherapy or targeted exercises. Please get some professional help with this, particularly if the pain continues to increase or does not improve with rest and over-the-counter pain medications.\n\nAlso, consider watching for any signs of nerve injury such as weakness, numbness or tingling in your arm or hand. Seek immediate medical assistance if you notice such symptoms."}

This month: BG 110 mg/dl, GTT one hour 184 mg/dl, two hours 115 mg/dl, morning insulin 5.3 \\xce\\xbcU/ml. Every other blood test within normal ranges. I am male 32 years old 1.86 cm 93 kg 13 to 14 % body fat athletic with healthy nutrition habits. No history of diabetes in the family. Could I be having cancer in pancreas judging from the insulin values you are seeing? I have had many years to do a blood test and with this random one seven months ago. I was told by my doctor that I had to keep monitoring my blood glucose since I could develop diabetes later on, and since I have never had a problem with blood sugar as a kid and no family history of diabetes, I was wondering what might be going on cause insulin levels dropped from my last test and since my diet was pretty much same with healthy choices why is this happening. My doctor for the last seven months kept telling me to calm down and that I do not have anything cause stressing is bad for my blood glucose too. Should I be telling him to get a pancreas MRI done?", "output": "Based on your lab results, it seems like you're showing signs of impaired glucose tolerance. Your recent blood glucose test shows that after drinking a sugar drink, your blood glucose is higher than normal but not enough to be classified as diabetes.\n\nThis could be an indicator for prediabetes - a condition where blood glucose level is higher than normal but not high enough to diagnose type 2 diabetes. Prediabetes can progress into type 2 diabetes, and weight loss through healthy eating and exercise can halt or reverse this progression.\n\nYour insulin levels are within the standard range, albeit toward the lower end. A gradual decline in insulin levels may suggest your pancreas isn't producing as much insulin, although this can also be due to several other factors including diet, stress, sleep etc. \n\nHaving said this, these lab results do not point towards a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer symptoms usually include abdominal pain, unexplained weight loss, yellowing of skin and eyes (jaundice) among others, which you have not reported here. However, if you are still concerned it's always good to discuss with your doctor about your worries.\n\nPlease note that simply having low insulin does not mean one has pancreatic cancer. Also, MRI should only be ordered when there is a substantial reason or suspicion based on multiple indicators, not merely what might seem as mild changes in insulin levels. This radiological examination comes with its own set of risks and shouldn't be used as first-line diagnostics without proper indications."}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hi doctor,I have noticed that my first molar is loose. I keep pushing it with my tongue and clenching a bit against it and I just noticed that it has become loose little more. I have my wisdom teeth and I think it might be applying pressure forward on these teeth. I read in a book that day grinding can cause a teeth to loosen, which is easier to treat. There is no pain and the teeth look healthy. I always clench my teeth but it never caused any looseness.", "output": "Your symptoms suggest that you may have bruxism or teeth grinding, which could be causing your loose molar. Pressure from wisdom teeth can also contribute to the problem. It's good news that there's no pain and the tooth appears healthy visually.\n\nHowever, a loose tooth is not something you should ignore. The mobility could increase over time, potentially risking your oral health. Proactive steps should be taken to prevent further loosening.\n\nYou should make an appointment with your dentist as soon as possible. They might recommend a night guard to protect your teeth if you grind or clench at night. If the pressure from your wisdom teeth is contributing to the problem, you may need to have them removed.\n\nIn the meantime, avoid putting extra pressure on the tooth - try not to push it further with your tongue or chew on that side of your mouth. Follow an effective plaque control regime: brush gently twice a day and floss daily to maintain good oral hygiene. This won't treat the looseness but will help prevent further damage."}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,We have a 9-month-old baby girl. She has five brown marks, two of them are 2 cm size and the other three of 0.5 cm. They are irregular in shape. Initial two marks appeared when she was 3 months old and now when she is 9 months three more for added that are comparatively light and 0.5 cm of size. Are these birthmarks? Will they fade with the time? Do we need to take any precautions so that they do not increase or get added further? Can we also provide any medication to cure them?", "output": "Your baby might have what we call congenital melanocytic nevi. These are essentially birthmarks that can vary in size and color, often brown, and generally appear at birth or soon afterward. While the exact cause isn't determined, they're thought to form as a result of skin cells failing to grow normally during their development.\n\nMost of these marks are harmless and do not require treatment. They may fade or darken with age, but typically they do not completely disappear. A small number of these nevi have an elevated risk for becoming cancerous later in life, especially large ones.\n\nYou should consult your pediatrician or a dermatologist who can examine them closely. If there is any concern regarding changes in shape, size, or color, they might advise regular monitoring or even a biopsy in some cases. However, with the sizes you mentioned, it's less likely.\n\nThere is no specific medication to cure them, as they are benign skin lesions. It would be best not to avoid sun exposure and apply sunscreen on your child if she's out in the sun.\n\nRemember, this advice doesn't substitute a proper consultation. It's always better to get her examined by a professional healthcare provider.\n"}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,I have red raised rashes in my legs and arms. I used Hydrocortisone cream, but there are no changes in it. Please help.", "output": "Without being able to see the rash, I can only provide a general advice. You may be dealing with some type of dermatitis, psoriasis or possibly an allergic reaction. The fact that Hydrocortisone Cream hasn't helped might suggest this rash isn't completely responsive to steroids, or it may simply mean that you need something stronger. It's also possible that it's infected, in which case a topical antibiotic could be needed.\n\nAlways remember to avoid scratching the area as much as possible. If itch is a problem, antihistamines such as Benadryl might help though they can cause drowsiness. \n\nHowever, given that there has been no improvement thus far, I strongly recommend that you make an appointment with a dermatologist for a physical examination as soon as possible so you can get a firm diagnosis and treatment plan. Keep in mind that this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific causes may need targeted treatments."}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor, I have been going to a dentist about a tooth that is sore. They started a root canal but then did not finish. I have gone back several times and every time they open up the tooth and insert medicine. My tooth is in agony right now. I am just wondering if this is a standard procedure during a root canal? Should not the dentist remove the nerves so I am not in so much pain? Or is it the standard procedure to fight the infection first and then remove the nerves?", "output": "Generally, a root canal treatment involves creating an opening in the tooth to reach and remove the infected pulp (which is comprised of nerves, blood vessels, and connective tissues), then cleaning and shaping the inside of the root canals, followed by filling and sealing the space. This procedure usually eliminates the pain you're experiencing as with the pulp removed, there are no more nerves in that tooth to transmit pain signals.\n\nHowever, sometimes if there's a severe infection or abscess at the end of the roots of your tooth, your dentist might not complete the whole process in one visit. They may instead use a temporary filling material and place medication within the tooth to help with the inflammation and infection before completely removing the pulp and finishing the root canal. \n\nBut continuous instances where the dentist re-opens the tooth and inserts medicine can also likely indicate complications or failure of the initial attempt at treating the tooth. One key point though - you should not be in \"agony\". Pain during a root canal is common but this should be manageable with over-the-counter analgesics, and should not extend for longer than a few days after each intervention.\n\nIn any case, persistent severe pain suggests something is not right. You may want to seek a second opinion from another dentist or consult with an endodontist (a specialist in root canal treatments) about your issue. Remember that all these suggestions are based on generic information and actual advice may vary depending upon various factors related to individual health conditions.\n"}

Whenever I consult the doctor, he gives me the same medication. Please help me.", "output": "It seems like you're dealing with recurrent eye pain which may be associated with prolonged use of contact lenses, dryness of the eyes, allergies or other underlying conditions. The medications you are using, Sterdex is a combination antibiotic and steroid used to treat inflammations in the eye, Chibro Cadron 5 ml is used for eye inflammation and Fluidabak is used to relieve symptoms of dry eyes.\n\nGiven your situation, I would advise a re-evaluation by an ophthalmologist. An eye exam including visual acuity test, slit lamp examination (a detailed view of the structures at the front of your eye), tonometry (check for glaucoma) and possibly a fundoscopy (examination of the back of your eye) will be required.\n\nSuggestions:\n1. Limit your usage of contact lenses\n2. Maintain hygiene while handling lenses\n3. Use artificial tears on a regular basis throughout the day.\n4. Update eyeglasses prescription if needed and try using glasses more often than contacts.\n\nAgain, it's very important you seek a consultation with an ophthalmologist to review your medication and confirm there are no serious conditions associated with your recurring eye discomfort.

(Can you assure there is no cancer)?", "output": "Unfortunately, as an AI, I cannot view physical attachments such as photographs. But based on the information you provided, it sounds like you might be experiencing some discomfort due to the EGD procedure itself; this is quite common in many patients and should subside over time. The chest pain when swallowing could be related to irritation caused by the endoscope or the polypectomy.\n\nRegarding medication, Pantoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) commonly used for conditions involving excess stomach acid, including hiatal hernias. This one should help with your symptoms. If the chest pain continues, I would recommend reaching out to your treating physician who might consider a short course of a mild painkiller if there are no contraindications. \n\nIn terms of diet, eating smaller meals more frequently, reducing fatty and spicy foods, and avoiding lying down immediately after eating can all be beneficial in managing hiatal hernia symptoms.\n\nAbout your cancer concern: if the doctor took biopsies during the EGD and confirmed no presence of cancer, that's very reassuring. However, keep in mind that your gastroenterologist knows your situation best. Considering your past history of breast cancer, continue following up regularly with both your primary care doctor and oncologist.\n\nRemember, online advice does not substitute an office visit, so please reach out to your personal doctor regarding these issues."}

What is the recommended dose that I have to take monthly? What are testosterone injections made from, are they made from an animal source? Will testosterone affects my personality? Do I have to take it for life? What if after some period I decided to stop will I loose what I gained?", "output": "Testosterone is the primary male sex hormone that plays key roles in the development of male reproductive tissues such as testes and prostate, as well as promoting secondary sexual characteristics like increased muscle and bone mass, and body hair growth. However, the use of testosterone injection should ideally be for those diagnosed with low or no testosterone because its misuse can lead to serious side effects.\n\n1. Testosterone could potentially make your appearance more \"masculine\" by increasing muscle mass and thickening your voice to some extent if it happens to be related to low testosterone levels.\n2. Only a healthcare professional can advise on appropriate dosage based on individual health conditions and needs. Because your testosterone levels are normal, it's not advisable to take extra testosterone without medical consultation.\n3. Testosterone used in injections isn't derived from animals; it's lab-synthesized to be bio-identical to human testosterone.\n4. As for personality changes, testosterone may influence mood and might cause increased aggression or competitiveness, but there's variability in individuals' responses.\n5. Unless you suffer from lifelong hypogonadism (where the body doesn't produce enough testosterone), you wouldn't necessarily need to take it for life. In fact, inappropriate usage can shut down your natural testosterone production, making you dependent on these injections for normal function.\n6.

Anyways, they are not going to stop smoking or drinking. I was looking at a way to have them not dry out the tissues, but stopping the obvious factors do not seem to be an option.", "output": "Both alcoholic and non-alcoholic mouthwashes are designed to kill bacteria in the mouth that cause bad breath, plaque, and gingivitis. However, they do vary slightly in their makeup and mode of action.\n\nAlcohol-based mouthwash has a high alcohol content which can help it to penetrate oral biofilms better and kill bacteria effectively. In addition to killing bacteria, alcohol also acts as a carrier agent for essential active ingredients like menthol, eucalyptol, and thymol which helps them permeate plaque.\n\nHowever, these alcohol-based mouthwashes can make the mouth dry by reducing saliva production over time. This can lead to more bad breath since saliva naturally counteracts bacteria and acid in the mouth. Alcohol can also irritate soft tissues in the mouth. \n\nNon-alcoholic mouthwash, on the other hand, often contains ingredients like cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) that kill bacteria without drying out the mouth. It doesn't contain alcohol, so this type could be more comfortable for those with sensitive mouths. Many tend to prefer non-alcoholic mouthwash because they find it less harsh to swish around in their mouth.\n\nGiven your concern about dehydration of oral tissues from smoking and alcohol use, recommending non-alcoholic mouthwashes may be beneficial for your patients. They should, however, still complement this with good dental hygiene practices such as regular brushing and flossing and tongue scraping.

These issues result from increased hemolysis or breakdown of red blood cells that are characteristic of this disease.\n\nWeight loss is not directly associated with hereditary spherocytosis; however, it may be indirectly related due to decreased appetite caused by feelings of discomfort or chronic anemia-related fatigue. The irregular menstrual cycle might also be indirectly related through hormonal imbalance induced by stress and long-term illness.\n\nThe removal of your gallbladder probably was done because individuals with hereditary spherocytosis have a higher risk of developing gallstones.\n\nIt's normal to feel worried about a chronic health condition like this. I would advise you reach out to your hematologist and discuss these concerns. It can also help to keep track of your symptoms and bring up any changes during your appointments. With proper management, most people with this disease can lead normal lives while managing their symptoms. The possible misdiagnosis is unlikely given your listed symptoms are consistent with hereditary spherocytosis.

Panic attacks can manifest in many different ways and often mimic physical symptoms such as shortness of breath, palpitations or even chest pain.\n\nSexual activity can be intense and physically demanding sometimes, which might add to physiological changes like heart rate elevation, and given your description, especially in combination with an anxiety disorder, this could contribute to triggering a panic-like response. It's important not to immediately attribute all symptoms to anxiety though.\n\nIf you continue experiencing these episodes, I would recommend that you discuss them with your healthcare provider, who may want to order additional tests - such as stress test, echocardiogram etc - to rule out any potential cardiovascular conditions considering the episode happened during strenuous activity. \n\nMaintaining a healthy lifestyle with regular exercise and balanced diet could also help reduce anxiety symptoms and improve both cardiovascular and overall health.

A platelet count of 1314 is considered high, this condition is known as thrombocytosis. It can be a sign of several conditions which could include:\n\n1. Anemia: This condition may arise due to iron deficiency or due to loss of blood.\n\n2. Inflammations: Conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease or infections can cause your platelet count to rise.\n\n3. Cancer: Certain types of cancer like lung, stomach, or ovarian cancer increases the production of platelets.\n\n4. Hemolytic anemia: This type of anemia occurs when your body destroys red blood cells before their normal lifespan is over, triggering your bone marrow to produce more blood cells and inadvertently, platelets.\n\n5. Splenectomy: If someone has had their spleen removed, the platelet count usually rises.\n\n6. Primary Thrombocythemia: This is a rare disorder where your body produces too many platelets \n\nYour doctors might need an additional investigation like a complete blood picture, ultrasound abdomen (to check for spleen size), and certain tests based on historical symptoms to diagnose the root cause. Please continue discussion with them about these possibilities for a definitive diagnosis and treatment plan.\n"}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hi doctor,I am a known diabetic for the past 15 years. 20 days ago, my HbA1c was 9.83. I am 54 years old and my weight is 87 kg. My medications are Metformin 500 mg, Hcl 1500 mg, Istavel 100 mg and Glaritus Insulin 30 units. Even then the sugar levels are 246, 265 and 277 after every three hours today. My creatinine, SGOT, SGPT, T3 and TSH are normal.", "output": "Hello,\n\nFirstly, I understand and appreciate your concern about your elevated blood sugar levels despite ongoing treatment. As you may know, an HbA1c level of 9.83 suggests that your diabetes is not well controlled over the past three months. Your current blood glucose readings are still quite high, which means further action needs to be taken.\n\nYour medication regimen indicates a combination of oral medications (Metformin, Istavel) and injectable insulin (Glaritus). However, with persistent high blood sugar levels, several possibilities should be considered:\n\n1. Medication Dosage: You might need an adjustment in dosage of your existing medication, or possibly an addition of other classes of diabetic medication to better manage your diabetic status.\n   \n2. Diet & Exercise: Review your diet and ensure it aligns with those recommended for someone managing Type 2 Diabetes. Regular moderate-intensity exercise can also enhance insulin sensitivity and help in management of blood glucose levels.\n    \n3. Insulin Resistance: This is a condition where the body does not respond to insulin leading to build up of glucose in the blood. It might require you to switch types of insulin or take higher doses.\n   \n4. Coexisting illness: Certain medical conditions like infections, thyroid disorders etc., although these seem unlikely since your TSH is normal and there's no mention of any symptoms indicative of infection.\n\n5. Patient Compliance: Ensure you're taking medicines as prescribed. Interrupted or incorrect medication use can affect blood sugar control.\n\n"}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hi doctor,When I have the fever, can I take Cetirizine in the morning and then Paracetamol in the afternoon?", "output": "Yes, you can. Cetirizine is an antihistamine used to relieve allergy symptoms such as watery eyes, runny nose, itching eyes/nose, and sneezing. It works by blocking a certain natural substance (histamine) that your body makes during an allergic reaction.\n \nOn the other hand, Paracetamol (also known as Acetaminophen) is commonly used to alleviate pain and reduce fever. There is no known significant interaction between these two drugs. However, it's always best to take medications as per your doctor's advice especially if you have any underlying medical conditions or if you're currently on other types of medications."}

I have attached a photo of the same. What are the likely causes?", "output": "Based on your description and without the ability to actually visualize your tongue as pictures cannot be attached here, it sounds like you may have oral thrush (candidiasis), a fungal infection caused by an overgrowth of the Candida species. It commonly presents with creamy white or yellow spots or a coating on the tongue and other parts of the mouth. A red border could indicate that the lesions are inflamed. \n\nWhile anyone can develop oral thrush, it's more likely in infants and elders, those with weakened immune systems, people who wear dentures or use inhalers for asthma, and those who have been treated with antibiotics or corticosteroids recently.\n\nHowever, there are other conditions that could cause similar symptoms so it would be best to reach out to a healthcare professional for a definite diagnosis. Other possibilities could include leukoplakia or lichen planus.\n\nPlease note that this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific causes may not apply to your situation. Always consult with a healthcare provider for accurate information."}

I have no fever or other symptoms. Should I be concerned? I had my atlas which was supposedly two degrees off by an atlas orthogonal chiropractor. I originally went in because of my knee and wrist pain then before I knew it, I was having my atlas adjusted by a machine. My last few days I have been miserable and feeling awful. Exhausted, my lymph nodes are so painful on the sides of my neck I have been in bed all day. I just feel this might be related but I do not know.", "output": "While it's not common for atlas adjustments to directly cause painful, swollen lymph nodes, there might be an unlikely indirect connection through systemic inflammation or your body responding to perceived injury. However, this intense level of discomfort and pain is concerning and may indicate a more serious issue such as an infection or another medical condition.\n\nLymph node swelling often indicates that your body is fighting against some form of infection or illness, even if you don\u2019t have other symptoms like fever. One possibility could be that the manipulation inadvertently caused some mild tissue damage, leading to local inflammation and reactive lymph nodes.\n\nNevertheless, these are speculations and I'd recommend making an appointment with a healthcare provider ASAP so you can get evaluated and treated appropriately. This needs thorough clinical evaluation to rule out any serious causes. Also monitor yourself closely for new symptoms like fever, weight loss, night sweats, etc.\n  \nIt's also worth noting that future chiropractic interventions should always align with your comfort level and understanding, and should never result in severe discomfort afterwards, so I would engage in a discussion about this incident with your care provider at your earliest opportunity."}

It seems like you may be experiencing peripheral neuropathy, which is often characterized by pain, tingling, and other unusual sensations in the extremities such as feet.\n\nFirst off, it's good that possible causes of peripheral neuropathy such as diabetes and alcoholism have been ruled out. While these are common causes, there are many others including certain medications (indeed, Cymbalta could potentially cause these symptoms), some infections, autoimmune diseases and trauma or pressure on the nerve.\n\nThe burning sensation might be related to your recently stopping Cymbalta, as abrupt cessation can lead to withdrawal effects, one of which includes abnormal sensations like \"pins and needles\". However, these usually resolve over time without treatment.\n\nYour stress and anxiety might also be contributing factors to your condition. Your body's reaction to stress can manifest physically, including exacerbating pain and discomfort.\n\nIn order to clarify things further, it would be beneficial to get a comprehensive health checkup. You should see a neurologist or pain specialist who can perform tests such as an electromyography (EMG) or nerve conduction study; these can provide information about the damage to nerves.\n\nTreatment of peripheral neuropathy focuses on treating the underlying cause and providing symptomatic relief. If indeed caused by withdrawing from Cymbalta, symptoms should decrease over time. Meanwhile, for symptom control, medications such as gabapentin, pregab"}

The symptoms you're describing could be suggestive of petechiae, which are small, round pin-point spots appearing under the skin that aren't typically raised or itchy. Petechiae happen due to bleeding under the skin and they can occur as a result of certain medical conditions, taking certain medications, injury/trauma, straining (like intense coughing or vomiting), or for reasons unknown.\n\nHowever, diagnosis requires face-to-face consultation with a trained physician.

The HSV IgM being positive suggests a recent or current herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, it's important to understand that this could be either oral or genital herpes.\n\nBefore you try to conceive, I recommend discussing this with your OB/GYN or an infectious disease specialist as there can potentially be transmission of HSV to the baby during delivery if there are active lesions. Treatment before getting pregnant might reduce the risk.\n\nYour doctor may also consider antiviral treatment or other precautionary measures during your pregnancy to prevent neonatal herpes. But every situation is different because whether herpes poses a threat depends on various factors such as timing of transmission and status of maternal antibodies.\n\nPlease remember that this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific causes may vary.

Is there a problem with his leg muscle?", "output": "As a doctor, it is important to reassure you that every child develops different skills at their own pace. At 14 months, it's not unusual for some children to have not started walking yet. Generally, most children start walking independently between 9 to 17 months. If your son has already started crawling, that\u2019s a good sign as it indicates he is gaining the strength and balance necessary to eventually move on to walking. \n\nHowever, if you notice any other symptoms such as lack of coordination, weakness, inability to bear weight  on his legs, or general motor skill delays, then it would be worth consulting with a pediatrician. It might also be recommended to check regular milestones like sitting without support, standing with assistance etc. If there are issues in those areas too, you should consult a pediatrician who may recommend a physical therapist.\n\nRemember, each child grows and develops at their own rate, so avoid comparing him to others."}

I do not have any problem with swallowing. Kindly advise me the needful.", "output": "Hello, it's great news that after taking antibiotics your tonsillitis pain has subsided. However, the feeling of something stuck in your throat might be a residual symptom from the infection, or could be due to another reason such as pharyngitis or even post nasal drip.\n\nFor now, you can try some home remedies like warm salt water gargles and hydration which is particularly good for keeping the mucus moist and thin thereby reducing the sensation of something being 'stuck'.\n\nHowever, if your symptoms persist beyond a week, or if you develop any other symptoms like weight loss, difficulty swallowing, voice changes or prolonged cough, do consult your doctor again since these could indicate conditions with greater severity that demand immediate attention. Do not ignore these signs if they appear. \nThis advice is given based on your described symptoms , but without proper physical examination and relevant investigations, accurate diagnosis cannot be made."}

However, based on your description, it seems like you might be dealing with a skin condition known as rosacea, perioral dermatitis or another similar type of chronic, inflammatory skin problem. These conditions are often associated with the symptoms you mentioned: small pimples that don't clear up, redness, and sensations of itching or burning.\n\nHowever, only a qualified professional healthcare provider can provide an accurate diagnosis. So, book an appointment with your dermatologist to confirm if this is what's causing the problems in your case. There they will enable customized treatment plans which may include oral antibiotics, topical creams, laser treatments, lifestyle changes, etc. \n\nRemember, not all skin disorders respond to over-the-counter products, regardless of how effective those products may be for other people or other types of skin issues. It's best not to self-medicate too much without knowing exactly what the problem is because you might inadvertently worsen the issue. The doctor might need to prescribe you something different than Metronidazole or tea tree oil.\n\nIn the meantime, try gentle cleansing, avoid picking or scratching at the area, and keep out of harsh weather as much as possible. Cold, wind, heat, and sun exposure can sometimes exacerbate these kinds of conditions. Maintaining a comforting and clean environment for your skin could help ease the situation till you visit your dermatologist."}

Here is my question: There are five pills left in the blister, and because of your advice I would like to quit right now from taking pills. Is it alright to stop now or should I finish the pills this month and then stop taking them?", "output": "If you already have an intrauterine device (IUD), like Mirena, then typically there's no need to take additional contraceptive pills. The IUD itself is effective in preventing pregnancy.\n\nRegarding your current situation where you have 5 pills remaining and wish to stop taking them due to the presence of the IUD, it should be safe for you to discontinue the pills now. This decision should not decrease the effectiveness of your birth control since you're relying on the Mirena.\n\nHowever, please understand that changes in hormones (due to starting or stopping birth control pills) can potentially lead to some side effects such as mood swings, changes in menstrual bleeding, or temporary changes in skin conditions. \n\nAdditionally, if your baseline body temperature is consistently high and not related to environmental factors, it would be worth checking with your healthcare provider to rule out any underlying causes such as infections, hormonal imbalances or other health issues. Changes in menstrual bleeding could also be due to adjusting to the IUD, but persistently heavy or long-lasting periods should also be evaluated by your healthcare provider."}

I went to my athletic trainer a month ago, and she told me she thinks it is just an aggravated muscle spasm. So she told me to just give it some rest from the activity that hurt it. So I gave it about a month, in which it seemed there was no pain. But as soon as I tried to do the activity that hurt me in the first place, it went right back to hurting. It would be of great help for any assistance. What should I do now?", "output": "From your description, it does sound like a muscle strain or spasm related to overuse from playing baseball. The fact that symptoms improved with rest but worsened when you returned to the activity suggests it's directly related to your sporting activities.\n\nHowever, given the severity and duration of your pain, I would advise seeing a healthcare professional for a full evaluation. They may recommend things like physical therapy, muscle relaxants, or exercises and stretches to help strengthen your lower back muscles and improve flexibility.\n\nFurthermore, they can rule out more serious conditions such as a herniated disc, which may present with similar symptoms. It is also advisable to seek instruction on proper form and warm-up exercises before returning to your sport in order to prevent this condition from recurring.\n\nUntil you are able to see a healthcare provider, try to rest, use heat or cold packs, take over-the-counter pain relievers, and avoid any activities that worsen the pain.

Please advise.She thought she was on her period the entire week. Bled for seven days. Sheattributed it to the Plan-b pill she took several weeks back. We hadunprotected sex but I still pulled out. She is on birth control andused a Plan-b pill. How is any of this miscarriage stuffpossible especially after just seeing the doctor the day beforemiscarriage?", "output": "Since both home and doctor's tests revealed a negative outcome, it suggests that the hormone levels which indicate pregnancy (human chorionic gonadotropin or hCG) were not high enough to be detected. It is feasible that your partner miscarried very early in the pregnancy when the hormonal changes are usually not substantial yet\u2014this is known as a chemical pregnancy.\n\nThe bleeding could actually have been the miscarriage itself rather than her period, especially if it was more painful or heavier than usual. Or, the miscarriage may have happened after the bleeding due to other factors.\n\nUsing emergency contraception like Plan-B and regular birth control might not always prevent every single instance of conception. Emergency contraception is most effective within 72 hours after unprotected sex and even then, is not 100% preventive. Similarly, no birth control method is completely foolproof. \n\nAs for another fetus remaining inside, it's quite unlikely given that a negative pregnancy test before the miscarriage would indicate absence of any detectable level of pregnancy hormones. Having one parent each who is a twin does raise the chances of having twins but doesn't guarantee it. Since this wasn't a confirmed pregnancy, it's hard to definitively say whether twins might have been possible.\n\nRegardless, I suggest your partner should see her doctor for follow-up care after her miscarriage to ensure she's recovering well physically and emotionally. Her doctor can undertake further investigations if he/she deems necessary based on her medical history.\n"}

You haven't specified the cause or source of your initial secondary burn, which could be important as it may still be affecting your healing process. Sulfa-medications (like SMZ/TMP DS) can unfortunately cause hypersensitivity reactions in some people, including rash and photosensitivity (i.e., sensitivity to sunlight).\n\nThe presentation you describe around your mouth could indeed be perioral dermatitis, characterized by red, scaly patches and tiny bumps or \"pustules\" aka whiteheads. However, keep in mind other possibilities too such as an allergic contact dermatitis - maybe from ingredients in lip products or toothpaste.\n\nMoisturizing is important but choose products wisely \u2013 many natural oils, like coconut oil or tea tree oil, can actually irritate or worsen certain conditions. In general, opt for hypoallergenic, non-comedogenic (won't clog pores), fragrance-free options when possible. \n\nSince over-the-counter self-treatment hasn't been successful, it might be best to revisit a healthcare provider.

However, I can help explain what doctors generally look for on a treadmill stress test and some conditions it may reveal.\n\nOn a treadmill stress test (also known as exercise ECG or Exercise Stress Test), physicians monitor:\n\n1. Heart rate response: Normally, heart rate increases with progressive exercise.\n2. Blood pressure response: Healthy blood pressure tends to rise during exertion but should not exceed certain values.\n3. Presence of chest pain or other suggestive symptoms.\n4. Physical performance: How someone manages the demands of increasing physical stress is also part of such a test.\n5. Electrocardiogram changes: Ischemia caused by coronary artery disease can result in specific changes in the electrocardiograph, including ST segment depression/elevation or T wave inversion.\n  \nIf your report mentions an infarction, it might be due to the presence of significant Q waves which are indicators of previous myocardial infarctions (\"heart attacks\"). The location of these waves can suggest the area of the heart affected and the possible artery involved. The severity and timing of an infarction cannot typically be determined precisely from a stress test alone; however, the presence of significant Q waves often indicates serious past damage.\n\nA machine error is unlikely if proper procedures were followed, though results should always be interpreted alongside clinical symptoms and further corroborated by diagnostic tools like imaging studies"}

They typically show up on the ridge of the glans (the 'head' of the penis).\n   \n2. Fordyce spots: These are tiny white or yellowish spots, found on the head or the shaft of the penis or in the scrotum. They're sebaceous glands (glands that produce sebum) that have no hair follicle and because of that, they appear as small spots. They are also completely normal and harmless.\n   \n3.

The antibody test I took is not a fourth generation test. Is it conclusive or should I take another test? If I repeat the HIV test after six months what is the chance of staying negative? I am facing the problem like small bumps in the tongue, from the last two days a little bit of pain below ear region and it is a little swollen. Is it due to HIV? I am stressed, scared, full of tension. These are hampering my life. I do not know what to do. Today I am in the 107th day of exposure.", "output": "Based on the HIV tests you've had done so far, it seems as though you are HIV negative. Typically, a test taken 3 months after exposure is considered conclusive. The ELISA antibody tests and the HIV proviral DNA PCR tests that you've had done are reliable at detecting the virus in your body.\n \nHIV may cause a variety of symptoms, however, most commonly these can include fever, sore throat, fatigue - signs that are often confused with a flu-like illness. What you're describing with bumps on your tongue and swelling/pain near your ear may be unrelated to an HIV infection, perhaps some other infection or inflammation. Of course, without further examination, it's difficult to provide a definitive answer.\n\nAs for repeating the HIV test 6 months post-exposure, under rare circumstances where the immune system takes longer to produce detectable antibodies, testing negative after six months would likely rule out HIV infection entirely. However, this level of delay in seroconversion is not common. \n\nRegardless, I recommend trying to stay calm and seeking medical attention for your current symptoms. Persistent anxiety over potential HIV infection despite multiple negative tests might mean that speaking with a mental health provider could be beneficial for you too. It's important to remember that although the virus can be life-changing, HIV is now considered a chronic but manageable disease, thanks largely to advances in antiretroviral therapy. Regular use of condoms provides excellent protection against transmission."}

My vision gets worse when I go to the eye doctor, but I have not had problems with infections. Recently I noticed that my left eye is red without pain or irritation, but red as the color of the pink eye. I do not know if it is the contact lenses which is causing the redness. Please help.", "output": "Sleeping with contact lenses on can lead to a number of problems, including but not limited to an increase in infections, corneal neovascularization (new blood vessels growing into the clear part of the eye), and changes in your cornea that may permanently affect your vision. That being said, it's impossible for me to diagnose exactly why your eye is red without an examination. The lack of pain or irritation is a good sign, but persistent redness can indicate a problem like inflammation or an infection, even if you've never had an infection before.\n\nYou absolutely must remove your contacts and stop wearing them immediately until you see your doctor. If the redness subsolves after removing the lens, then it was most likely due to the contact lens - perhaps hypoxia (lack of oxygen) to your cornea, since constant contact use does not allow enough oxygen to reach the cornea. But if redness continues or gets worse, this could be an emergency situation such as a corneal ulcer. Please seek immediate medical attention from an ophthalmologist promptly when symptoms persist.\n  \nPlease remember to follow proper contact lens hygiene moving forward: do not sleep in your lenses unless they are specifically designed for extended wear, always cleanse them properly, replace as recommended by your eye care provider, and take breaks from wearing them when possible."}

Dental injuries often require immediate attention and if left untreated can lead to severe complications such as an infection or permanent damage.\n\nPainkillers can aid in managing the pain but avoid taking Aspirin right now as it might increase the bleeding. Try not to touch or agitate the area more than necessary. Consider rinsing your mouth with a warm salt water solution (half a teaspoon of salt dissolved in 8 ounces of warm water) \u2013 this will help keep your mouth clean.

With parents of 5'1\" and 5'9\", as an average you can anticipate reaching somewhere around the mid-range given your current height at age 17. \n\nWhile certain studies point towards potential benefits of glucosamine for cartilage health, it is not directly correlated with increasing growth in humans and I would advise against using it purely for that purpose.\n\nConsidering your insomnia, anxiety, and depression, these conditions could potentially impact your physical health, including stunting growth if they caused significant malnutrition or distress during critical growth periods. However, it seems you\u2019ve been maintaining good nutritional habits overall, which is very beneficial.\n\nRegarding calcium and protein, both are indeed crucial nutrients for growth and bone health but they don't have to come only from dairy products.

However, it might not be effective for everyone, particularly if you have cystic acne, which tends to be more stubborn.\n\nA topical retinoid, such as adapalene (which can be known commercially as Differin) may be more beneficial. Adapalene works by promoting cell turnover, unclogging pores, and reducing inflammation.\n\nFor pigmentation, I would suggest using a product with niacinamide and vitamin C. The former works to even skin tone and reduce post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation while the latter encourages collagen production and helps to lighten dark spots. However, bear in mind these products should be used consistently for at least couple of months to see meaningful results.\n\nPreventing further breakouts will involve regular exfoliation and cleansing.

Psychological stress at times manifests as a lump or foreign body sensation in the throat - this is known as Globus Sensation. \n\nHowever, persistent symptoms warrant further investigation to rule out other conditions like infections or conditions involving the esophagus, even some rare tumors. \n\nTherefore, although the possibility of serious problems are relatively low based on your current description, it's still recommended that you consult with an Ear-Nose-Throat specialist in-person for a thorough evaluation. You should never overlook any persistent symptoms or discomfort in your body. Please act promptly and seek medical advice."}

Can someone please tell me how to use it with SPF 30, that is how to combine SPF 30 for a surgical scar because Contractubex does not come with instructions on how to use it mixing it with SPF 30. I had surgery on right cheek to remove the black birthmark.", "output": "Contractubex is widely used to treat scars after surgical operations. Here are the general instructions on how to use it:\n\n1. Cleanse and dry the scarred area before you apply Contractubex.\n\n2. Apply a thin layer of Contractubex onto the scar gently without rubbing.\n\n3. Ideally for fresh scars, It should be applied 2-3 times daily for at least 3 months for better results. \n\nRemember, Contractubex will take time to reduce the scarring process so don't expect instant results.\n\nTo combine it with SPF 30:\n\n1. After applying Contractubex, let your skin absorb the gel completely. \n   \n2. Then, apply SPF 30 sunscreen over the top once the Contractubex has fully dried. Using sunscreen will prevent any potential darkening or discoloration from sun exposure which can often make scars more noticeable.\n\nHowever, communication with your plastic surgeon or dermatologist would be beneficial as they know more about your specific case than anyone could online. Follow up with them and ask when starting to use products like these. Your health care professional's advice would always supersede any information you find here or anywhere else.\n  \nTake note that Contractubex might not be recommended for use in open wounds until they have completely healed. Be cautious about using it too soon post-surgery as this may hinder the healing process."}

Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen may help with inflammation and pain as well.\n\nTry not to move your neck excessively or perform activities that cause pain. Gentle range of motion exercises (moving your head gently up and down, side to side) may be beneficial but should not bring about more pain.\n\nHowever, if there is no improvement over the next couple of days, if your pain increases, it becomes unbearable despite medication or you start feeling numbness, tingling, or weakness in your arms or hand, please seek immediate medical attention, as these could be signs of a more serious condition like a herniated disc or nerve impingement."}

It's good that your temperature is normalized now, but the persisting rashes and joint pain should not be ignored.\n\nInfections often result in an immune response that can include swollen lymph nodes and painful, swollen joints. Furthermore, some medications can lead to skin rashes and joint pains as side effects.\n\nHowever, it doesn't sound typical for Paracetamol (Biogesic) to cause these kinds of side effects. Considering it's Sunday and you started with a fever Tuesday night, your symptoms have been present for almost a week - which is concerning.\n\nIt would be ideal for more advanced testing. Consultation with an infectious disease specialist, allergist, or rheumatologist may be beneficial depending on what turns up in initial screenings.\nPlease make sure to call ahead to get advice about how to proceed, they might instruct you differently due to the Covid pandemic.\n\nStay hydrated and continue taking the prescribed paracetamol if it helps.

Currently, she consumes a combination of Cilnidipine and Metoprolol and also other allied drugs in an emergency.", "output": "I'm sorry to hear that your mother is having difficulties with her blood pressure. Given the recurrent nocturnal high blood pressure and increased heart rate, we should consider either dosage adjustment, a different class of antihypertensive drugs, or an additional medication. However, it's not appropriate for me to make full medication management decisions. \n\nIt's essential she has regular reviews with her primary care physician or cardiologist. They're best placed to assess whether changes to her treatment plan are necessary considering her all other medical conditions and mediations (including any non-prescription medications and supplements).\n\nAlso, lifestyle modifications such as reducing sodium intake, maintaining a healthy weight, moderating alcohol consumption, increasing physical activity, and following a healthy diet can greatly assist in controlling blood pressure.\n\nLowering stress levels through relaxation techniques might help with high pulse rate. If these measures don't completely control her symptoms, then further investigations may be needed, including possible 24-hour ambulatory Blood pressure monitoring or sleep studies to exclude conditions like nighttime asthma, sleep apnea or other sleep disorders which can affect BP during the night. \n\nGenerally, dose adjustments or prescription changes have to be done under careful professional supervision. It is vital she never stops taking medication without first consulting with her healthcare provider due to risk of rebound high blood pressure or other complex issues.

I am not sure what it is? Neither of us have STDs. I am quite scared of being pregnant. I do not remember when I had my last period. Is this discharge normal? Please help me.", "output": "Without examining you in person or being able to see the photographs, I can't provide a definitive diagnosis, but I can share that some changes in vaginal discharge are normal depending on where you are in your menstrual cycle. Regular white or clear vaginal discharge (leukorrhea) is usually healthy. However, a brownish or yellowish discharge could indicate various conditions such as bacterial vaginosis, yeast infection, or sexually transmitted infections. \n\nIt's important to note that having unprotected sex always carries the risk of pregnancy if it occurs during your fertile days. As for the pain you experienced, it could be due to many factors including but not limited to: inadequate lubrication, an infection, or an underlying medical condition.\n\nMy recommendation would be to take a home pregnancy test since you cannot recall when your last period was and you're worried about possibly being pregnant. You should also schedule an appointment with your healthcare provider who can properly examine you, evaluate your symptoms, and potentially order tests to rule out any infections or other conditions. \n\nUsing protection during sexual activities is crucial, not just to prevent unwanted pregnancy but also to avoid getting or transmitting STDs. Even if both of you believe that you don't have STDs, it's still possible to contract one without knowing. Many STDs are asymptomatic at first which means they don't show any symptoms until they've progressed. It's always safer to use contraception like condoms. Please take care of your health."}

{"instruction": "", "input": "Hi doctor,My mother is suffering from a left femoral neck fracture. Is there any other treatment other than surgery? Please suggest.", "output": "Treatment options for a femoral neck fracture greatly depend on the age of the patient, her overall health status and the type of fracture. The fact is that in many cases, particularly when there's significant displacement or angulation of the fracture, surgical intervention is usually needed to ensure proper healing and restoration of function.\n\nHowever, in certain situations with minimally displaced fractures, conservative treatments might be considered. This consists of minimal movement, rest, physical therapy, pain management, etc. Still, this approach bears a risk of nonunion or avascular necrosis due to altered blood supply to the femoral head that might result in chronic pain and loss of function.\n\nYou should discuss your mother\u2019s case with her orthopedic surgeon who can give you the best advice after evaluating her situation, taking into consideration the nature of fracture, her age, and her overall health condition."}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hi doctor,My fiancee and I are not known HIV positive. But we have had unprotected anal sex ten times so far. Can we be infected with HIV?", "output": "HIV is primarily transmitted through direct contact with certain body fluids from a person who has HIV. These body fluids include blood, semen (cum), pre-seminal fluid (pre-cum), rectal fluids, vaginal fluids, and breast milk. Unprotected sex can certainly be a risk factor for transmission of HIV.\n\nHowever, if both of you are not HIV positive (and assuming you both have been tested accurately and haven't had sexual encounters with anyone else who could potentially be HIV positive) then it would generally be safe to say that your risk of contracting HIV from each other is negligible, because one cannot transmit what one does not have.\n\nNonetheless, do remember that unprotected sex can put you at risk for other sexually transmitted infections as well. Using protection such as condoms reduces this risk. Regular testing and communication about sexual health status with your partner/s are also important parts of maintaining sexual health."}

I also tried not taking the Lorazepam at all and woke up crying, shaking and sweating. I want to be off both these medicines but I am worried more about the Lorazepam as it is a class D pregnancy drug. I have read about the terrible problems this causes for infants.

You took steps to protect yourself by using a condom and taking emergency contraception (Unwanted 72) within the recommended time frame after a potential risk of pregnancy occurred (the condom breaking). The emergency contraceptive pill (\"morning-after\" pill) works primarily by preventing or delaying ovulation; it does not terminate an existing pregnancy.\n\nThe bleeding you experienced was likely due to the hormonal fluctuation caused by the emergency contraceptive pill. A negative urine pregnancy test further supports that you're not pregnant, as these tests are typically accurate about one week after a missed period or two weeks after ovulation, which would be around the time you tested if your withdrawal bleed was similar in timing to your regular period. \n\nHowever, emergency contraceptives aren't 100% effective. If you feel concerned or notice symptoms such as nausea, abdominal cramping, breast tenderness, fatigue, frequent urination or if your next regular period is late, consider asking your healthcare provider for a blood pregnancy test which can detect smaller amounts of the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) than a urine test.\n\nPlease remember that condoms not only protect against pregnancy but also sexually transmitted infections (STIs), so ensure they are used correctly and do not break."}

Current scientific evidence does not suggest Perinorm tablets (known also as Metoclopramide, a medication used to treat certain types of nausea and vomiting) cause an increase in myopia (-1.5 is a form of myopia or nearsightedness).\n\nAs for homeopathic treatments, there isn't strong scientific support that they are effective in reducing or eliminating the need for corrective lenses. \n\nHere's what you can do:\n\n1. Regular eye checkups - Optometrists recommend that adults have their eyes checked every one to two years. This will help detect any changes early and adjust your eyeglass prescription if needed.\n\n2. Healthy lifestyle - Eating a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, particularly dark leafy greens, helps promote eye health. Regular physical exercise also benefits overall health including eyes. Avoid smoking, excessive alcohol and reduce prolonged digital screen time.\n\n3. Protective eye wear - Wear sunglasses that block out 99% to 100% of both UV-A and UV-B radiation.\n\n4.

Oral Cancer: Although rare, black spots on the tongue can potentially indicate oral cancer. If you notice a spot that continues to grow or doesn't go away after two weeks, it's very important to get checked out by a doctor as soon as possible.\n\n5. Fungal infection: Certain fungal infections like oral candidiasis can cause black spots but this is less common.\n\nIf you're noticing new or persisting black spots on your tongue, it might be worth seeking medical advice so that a proper examination can be done to identify its cause."}

She has this problem from a long time. She has a bad habit of holding her urine for a long time until she can hold it no more.", "output": "I'm sorry your daughter is having these issues. Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) can be caused by a variety of factors, one of which is holding in urine for prolonged periods, as this allows bacteria to grow in the urinary tract.\n\nThe mainstay of UTI treatment is antibiotics, to clear up the infection. This antibiotic treatment is usually continued for several days and it\u2019s important that she completes the full course, regardless of whether she feels better midway through the treatment. \n\nIn addition therefore, consider implementing some lifestyle changes:\n\n1. Encourage her not to hold in her urine when she needs to go, but rather, get her into the habit of using the bathroom regularly.\n2. Ensure she drinks plenty of fluids each day, particularly water, to help flush out any potential bacteria.\n3. Cranberry juice or supplement could potentially reduce frequency of UTIs (though further research is needed)\n\nIf the problem persists despite these measures, you may need to see a urologist, or a pediatrician who specializes in Pediatric Nephrology/Urology, for further workup. It may be necessary to check if there are anatomical problems with bladder emptying completely, or reflux of urine from bladder toward kidneys.\n\nRemember: She needs to be seen by a doctor in person though, always follow their direction - they know your medical history best."}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,I need to know about cardiac dysfunction. I was told it was found on venous Doppler looking at DVT. What all information can you tell me about the blood vessels having a pulse and it being a cardiac dysfunction? That is all I was left with until the cardiologist consult.", "output": "Cardiac dysfunction refers to a broad category of conditions in which the heart is not able to pump blood efficiently. This can occur for many reasons, including damage from heart attacks, high blood pressure, various forms of heart disease and conditions that overwork the heart.\n\nThe venous Doppler study you mentioned is used to assess the flow of blood in veins, often performed to detect or rule out deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a blood clot within a deep vein usually in your legs. It uses ultrasound technology to produce images and sounds of the blood flowing through your arteries and veins.\n\nWhen we talk about 'blood vessels having a pulse', it's generally related to arteries rather than veins. Arteries carry oxygenated blood from the heart to the rest of the body and they do exhibit a pulse since blood pressure increases each time your heart pumps blood (systole). Veins, on the other hand, carry deoxygenated blood back towards the heart under substantially lower pressure so typically don't have a noticeable 'pulse'. \n\nHowever, some medical conditions can lead to pulsations in the big central veins situated closer to the heart. If an unusual 'venous pulse' was detected during your Doppler scan, it might suggest some type of cardiac dysfunction, possibly due to right-sided heart problems or other structural abnormalities. \n\nPlease keep in mind this is just a general explanation based on information given. Your cardiologist will give you a more accurate diagnosis after assessing all relevant tests and clinical"}

After which surgery, can I lift heavy weights?I am a sports person and a bodybuilder. Please suggest.", "output": "Both open surgery and laparoscopic techniques have their own advantages in treating an umbilical hernia, and the best course of action really depends on individual factors like the size and severity of your hernia, your overall health status, and more.\n\nLaparoscopic surgery is a less invasive procedure with typically shorter recovery times compared to traditional open surgery. There's usually less post-operative pain, fewer complications, smaller scar, and patients are often able to return to normal activities sooner.\n\nHowever, heavy lifting and intense workouts can put strain on the surgical site and may increase chances for recurrence of the hernia or other complications. Regarding resuming these activities, you would need to follow the recovery plan as outlined by your surgeon regardless of which method is chosen. It generally takes several weeks up to a few months before one can return to strenuous exercise after hernia surgery.\n\nSince you're a bodybuilder who wants to get back to heavy lifting, it is very important that you have this discussion with your surgeon. They will be the best person to advise you based on the specifics of your situation, so I strongly suggest having a detailed conversation about your lifestyle and workout routine with them. Also ask about risk reduction strategies for umbilical hernia given your profession.\n"}

I have an upcoming appointment but am worried about a possible infection to the bone? If this is the case would I have severe pain and swelling?", "output": "Hello! It's unfortunate to hear about your dental issues, but I'm glad you finally have an appointment set up. Persistent dental caries (cavities) can indeed lead to complications like tooth abscesses, which are infections that can potentially spread to the bone if left untreated for a long period of time.\n\nThe signs of such an infection could include severe pain, swelling in your face or cheek, sensitivity to heat and cold, fever, pus drainage, swollen lymph nodes and a bad taste in your mouth from drainage of an abscess. It must be noted however that everyone\u2019s pain threshold is different so you may not necessarily experience all or extreme forms of these symptoms.\n\nSince you know you have cavities it's very important to get this addressed as soon as possible. Antibiotics are usually prescribed initially to start fighting off any infection, followed by procedures to definitively address the source of the problem, which in this case would be treating the cavities. Good luck with your upcoming dental appointment!\n"}
{"instruction": "", "input": "What are some common causes of one sided SI joint Pain that comes and goes? I\\m 25 and just had a baby (naturally) 10 months ago. Back pain started at 8 months Postpartum .", "output": "One-sided Sacroiliac (SI) joint pain can be caused by various factors. In your case, it's likely that pregnancy and childbirth have significantly contributed to the onset of this condition. \n\n1. Pregnancy and Childbirth: During pregnancy, hormones are released in a woman's body that allow ligaments to relax. This relaxation prepares the body for childbirth but can also lead to less stability in the SI joint, causing discomfort or pain. Moreover, natural childbirth can stress or injure the SI joints.\n\n2. Postural Changes and Body Weight: Carrying a baby changes a woman's center of gravity so they might change their regular posture without realizing it. Increased weight during pregnancy can put additional pressure on these joints as well.\n\n3. Musculoskeletal Changes: Sometimes the muscles around the sacroiliac joint may not recover totally after pregnancy which can cause imbalance leading to pain. \n\n4. Unilateral Stresses: Activities such as standing on one leg for long periods of time, climbing stairs, running, or any activity that involves loading more weight onto one leg can provoke SI joint dysfunction.\n\n5. Trauma or Injury: Any accidental trauma or injury in daily life can affect SI Joint resulting in pain.\n\n6.

Sadly, I declined rapidly and lost all my hypotheaner and some of my lumbericals in a matter of six weeks. I was operated on exactly 14 weeks ago where I had a decompression of the ulnar nerve and an anterior interosseous nerve transfer to the motor component of the ulnar nerve so that the nerve axons would reach my hand quicker. I still have no improvement and I wanted to ask if it is possible to transfer muscle to fill in the hand? And will this protect my nerves in the hand? Would it be too soon to be considering this operation?", "output": "As a doctor, it's important to remember that nerve recovery after surgery is usually a slow process, often taking months or even up to a year. Given the complexity of your surgical procedure (decompression and anterior interosseous nerve transfer), 14 weeks may not be sufficient time for noticeable improvement.\n\nRegarding your question about muscle transfer, it's indeed possible as a last resort - generally in cases where peripheral nerves aren't expected to regain function. Muscle transfers can help restore some functionality but may not necessarily 'protect' the nerves per se. However, this needs detailed evaluation by your treating doctor.\n\nI would recommend continuing your rehabilitation exercises and maintaining a close follow-up with your doctor in order to monitor the progress of nerve healing. You should explore all therapeutic options including muscle transfer only if there's confirmed non-progression of nerve regeneration over an acceptable duration of time. Your surgeon will advise you better on when to consider further intervention, as they have more knowledge about the specifics of your case.\n\nIt's very important to express your concerns to your doctor.

Generally, a full course of chemotherapy for breast cancer can range from three to six months but it varies greatly depending on the type and stage of disease as well as personal health factors. The number of cycles you need specifically will depend on your oncologist\u2019s treatment plan. Sometimes, short breaks may be given between cycles based on patient's tolerance and response.\n\nYour symptoms like loss of appetite, difficulty swallowing, vomiting, and altered bowel habits are common side-effects of chemotherapy. Please communicate these concerns with your oncology team as there are medications that can help manage them.\n\nFurthermore, depression is not uncommon in patients undergoing cancer treatments. It's essential you discuss this with your healthcare provider as well; they can refer you to resources or professionals who can provide mental health support during this trying period.\n\nRegarding your left breast, after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (which you're currently receiving), standard management usually involves surgical removal of any residual cancer in the form of lumpectomy or mastectomy. Post-surgery, reconstruction procedures can certainly be discussed if the expected cosmetic result without intervention is unfavorable. Breast reconstruction can be done using implants or even natural tissue from other parts of the body. This typically happens several months after finishing chemotherapy. \n\nPlease know that every patient's situation is unique, and I advise discussing all your questions in detail with your treatment team who have all details related to your specific case.\n"}

Please tell me what to do. Her birth weight is 3.2 and now she is around 9 I think.", "output": "Every child develops at their own pace and just because your older daughter started speaking earlier, it doesn't necessarily mean your younger daughter should too. It's perfectly normal for some children to start speaking later than others. Expectations around language development tipically indicate that 2 year olds might say 50 or more words sprinkled with two-word sentences.\n\nRemember, comprehension precedes expression. If she's understanding what you're saying and following simple instructions, that's a good sign of her linguistic progress. However, if by the age of 2 she is only using very few words, cannot understand simple instructions, or fails to imitate words and sounds, please follow up with a healthcare professional as these could be red flags for a possible speech delay or disorder.\n\nIf this is the case, early intervention services such as speech therapy can help significantly.

The symptoms you described - fever, vomiting, loose stool, loss of appetite - could be signs of a gastrointestinal infection, possibly due to bacteria or parasites.\n\nThe tendency to feel nauseous even after the symptomatic treatment with Emeset and reluctance to eat may occur because her digestive system is still recovering. It's also important to ensure she stays properly hydrated as diarrhea can lead to dehydration.\n\nHowever, if her condition does not improve in the next few days or if she starts showing new symptoms (like blood in stools, severe abdominal pain), it would be advised to consult with your doctor again.

{"instruction": "", "input": "Hi doctor,My front tooth got chipped away before two days. I am so nervous about it. How to recover my tooth?", "output": "Repairing a chipped tooth depends on the size of the chip and its location. There are several techniques your dentist might use:\n\n1. Dental Bonding: This procedure involves applying a putty-like resin to the damaged tooth that is shaped and colored to match your surrounding teeth. The resin is hardened with a UV light, effectively bonding it to the tooth.\n\n2. Dental Veneers: If you have a larger chip, a dental veneer could be an option. It's a thin shell made of porcelain or composite material placed over the front surface of the tooth.\n\n3. Dental Crowns: If a large piece of your tooth has broken off or if there's a lot of decay, a crown might be necessary. A crown is basically a cap for the damaged tooth.\n\n4. Dental Implants: In more severe cases where the tooth cannot be saved, it may need to be extracted and replaced with a dental implant.\n\nIn the meantime until you see a dentist, avoid biting down on hard food with the chipped tooth and try to keep the area clean. Over-the-counter pain relievers can help manage discomfort. Make sure you make an appointment with your dentist soon so they can examine your tooth and recommend the most appropriate course of treatment.\n"}

Coupled with my mother's exact issue, and cure, I am not sure what these results could mean? What should my next step be and could this elevated FT3 cause my anxiety to start?", "output": "T3 plays a role in mood regulation, as there's considerable interaction between thyroid hormones and the nervous system. However, linking slightly high FT3 levels as the sole cause of your anxiety and OCD can be quite complex since mental health issues generally have multifactorial etiologies involving interplay between genetics, environment, brain chemistry amongst others. Furthermore, thyroid function tests are best interpreted considering all the values together such as TSH, FT4 along with clinical picture.\n\nGiven that your symptoms re-emerged recently, it'd be wise to get another full panel thyroid test (Free T3, Free T4, TSH, Anti-thyroid antibodies) done. This would ensure the initial value wasn't a random peak or lab error and whether any autoimmunity is involved like your mother. If these reports come back abnormal, you may be referred for further treatment by an endocrinologist.\n\nMeanwhile, continue taking your current medication and consider follow up with a psychiatrist/therapist to keep your symptoms under control. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy has been proven to help manage symptoms of anxiety and OCD.

{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,I am a 30 year old male, who is a competitive athlete. I do not have any structural or plumbing heart issues. I have been diagnosed with WPW accidentally, and I am waiting for an ablation in 17 days. I am mostly asymptomatic, and I never had any extremely rapid heart rates. My resting heart rate is actually in the 40\\s. However, I do sometimes get palpitations and every once in awhile get a run of 5 to 7 in a row. The EP I saw in the hospital prescribed me Flecainide 50 mg, twice daily. I saw another EP, who was a much older guy, as a second opinion. He seems to think I do not need the Flecainide, and maybe not even the ablation. I do not agree with him on the ablation due to recent medical studies on WPW and how ablation is recommended even for asymptomatic patients, especially athletes.My question is regarding Flecainide. I have not had any palpitations since I began taking it a few days ago, but I want to make sure this drug is not putting me at risk for creating a dangerous rhythm. Reading case studies and medical journals, it seems there is some risk. I have not been known to go into AF, and besides palpitations, I am asymptomatic with WPW. Do you think Flecainide at this dosage is safe and reasonable for the next two weeks, until my ablation?", "output": "Flecainide is generally used to prevent certain types of life-threatening irregular heartbeats. Though it does carry some risks, it can be a valuable tool in the management of arrhythmias such as WPW syndrome. Common side effects include dizziness, vision changes, and nausea.\n\nRegarding your specific concern about the drug inducing dangerous rhythms - Flecainide has been known to exacerbate or precipitate certain types of ventricular arrhythmias, particularly in people with structural heart disease, which you mention you do not have. In your case, where it is being used short term (two weeks) leading up to an ablation procedure, this would typically be considered less risky. However, decisions like these should be individualized based on the specifics of your condition and risk profile.\n\nIt's excellent that you are proactively seeking out information and advocating for your health! Ultimately, this should be a discussion between you and your electrophysiologist. If you have concerns about taking Flecainide, even after this discussion, remember that you ultimately make the final decision about your treatment. Be sure to reach out to your healthcare provider if you notice any troubling symptoms or if you have further questions.\n"}

It works by restoring the natural balance of certain substances (neurotransmitters) in the brain.\n\nIt's important to understand that everyone responds differently to medications, so if your psychiatrist prescribed this, it may have been with the intention of managing your depression symptoms. However, you should never start taking it without consulting your current healthcare provider first, especially after this much time has passed.\n\nIt's concerning that you're not feeling well lately. If your depression symptoms are getting worse or if you're having any thoughts about suicide, reach out to a healthcare provider immediately. You don't necessarily need to go back to your old psychiatrist - another medical professional like a primary care doctor, another psychiatrist, or even a certified nurse practitioner could help.\n\nRemember, there's no need to suffer in silence.

But from yesterday my breast has shrunk and my nipples too. There are a few lumps on my nipple as well. Even though I apply cream it is not getting relieved. It is getting worse day by day.", "output": "I'm sorry to hear about your concerns. From what you told me, the symptoms you're experiencing could be related to breastfeeding including dry, cracked nipples and development of lumps (blocked milk ducts). Although a decrease in size might be due to reduced milk production or blocked ducts issues, any changes in your breasts including shrinking should be evaluated by a health professional to rule out any serious issues such as cancer.\n\nIt's important to remember that most breast changes are not cancerous, but it's always best to have them checked out to be on the safe side. I advise you to complete a clinical breast exam done by your doctor or a healthcare provider who can also suggest you the proper treatment for nipple soreness due to breastfeeding.\n\nRemember, early detection and diagnosis allow the widest range of treatment options."}

Could you please suggest any prevention tablet which can prevent the pregnancy after sex without any side effects?", "output": "You may want to consider emergency contraception (\"morning-after pill\"), which can be used to prevent pregnancy after having unprotected sex. There are a couple of different brands available like Plan B One-Step, Take Action, AfterPill or Ella.\n\nPlan B One-Step (or its generic versions) can be taken up to 72 hours after unprotected intercourse, while Ella can be taken up to 120 hours after unprotected intercourse. \n\nHowever, please remember that these medications are most effective when used as soon as possible after the unprotected intercourse. They decrease in effectiveness over the course of those 72/120 hours. Also note that they are not meant to be used as regular birth control but rather for emergencies only. \n\nMost women can use morning-after pills with little to no side effects, the most common ones being nausea and vomiting, tiredness and headache, changes to your menstrual cycle, dizziness and abdominal discomfort. These generally do not last long.\n\nDespite their relative safety profile, it is always good practice to consult with a healthcare provider before taking any medication - to fully understand their benefits and potential risks. For a more long term family planning options I would recommend getting an appointment with a gynecologist so you can discuss contraceptive methods suited specifically for you possible side effects, etc."}

The previous infection was before six months. It is present at the bottom of one of my lower molars. It hurts me a lot. How long will it take to spread throughout the body?", "output": "It's concerning that you've had an abscess for over a year now. Dental abscesses can lead to serious, potentially life-threatening complications if not treated promptly as the bacteria in an abscess can spread to other parts of your body through your bloodstream. \n\nThis spread could occur anywhere from days to weeks depending on various factors like your overall health, whether or not you're receiving any kind of treatment, how strong your immune system is, etc.\n\nHowever, I would strongly advise against waiting to see when it might spread and instead seek urgent dental care. Let a dentist examine you, assess the severity of the infection, and determine the best course of action which may involve draining the abscess, root canal treatment or extraction of the tooth, accompanied by antibiotics to clear up the infection.\n\nMoreover, recurrent dental abscesses could signify underlying issues such as poor oral hygiene, a high sugar diet, or existing dental conditions that need assessment and treatment. If you have systemic symptoms like fever, chills, swelling in your face or cheek, or trouble breathing or swallowing, they are signs that the infection has already begun to spread, this requires emergent medical attention and you should head straight to the emergency department of a hospital."}

I have got ultrasounds but just shows increased blood, no abscesses.", "output": "Based on your symptoms and initial efforts, it seems like you have been diagnosed with orchitis, which is inflammation of one or both testicles. It's usually caused by an infection and can be related to epididymitis - a tube that carries sperm from the testicle where inflammation can also occur because of an infection. \n\nOne common cause, especially for sexually active men under 35 years, is sexually transmitted infections (STIs) like gonorrhea or chlamydia. Another common cause is viral infections such as mumps in children who aren't vaccinated. These would typically present with other symptoms though or show up in lab results.\n\nGiven that antibiotics don\u2019t seem to be solving the problem, it could suggest this might not be bacterial but perhaps viral. But since you have had a fever for a continuous period of time and a C-reactive protein of 231 indicating significant inflammation, it suggests there's still an ongoing process. There's a chance your body is resistant to the antibiotic, or it could be an atypical bacteria.\n\nYour doctor might need to consider alternative diagnosis such as autoimmune orchitis or possibly even a rare form of cancer called testicular lymphoma which preferentially affects older individuals, although these are more rare possibilities. \n\nFurther investigation is needed.

Her orthodontist referred her to a maxillofacial surgeon who says she needs her upper jaw broken and rotated clockwise and slightly up to compensate for the lack of bone and her bottom jaw also has to be broken and rotated clockwise. It would all then be held by plates and screws. My biggest concern is that she is a beautiful girl and he says that her face will not change at all. Is that true with this kind of procedure?", "output": "It's completely understandable to be concerned about possible changes in your daughter's appearance from maxillofacial surgery. The kind of procedure being proposed, known as orthognathic surgery, is typically performed to correct functional problems, like improving \"bite\" or to help with sleep apnea, rather than to alter appearance.\n\nIn general, when done correctly by a skilled surgeon, the change in facial structure can be minimal and subtle. However, each individual\u2019s results may vary. Aspects such as swelling after the operation would temporarily alter her face but once healed, it should return to normal. One aspect to keep in mind is that these procedures do tend to highlight the patient's existing facial features, so this could slightly change the overall aesthetic look. \n\nI recommend you have an in-depth conversation with the maxillofacial surgeon. Ask if they can show you before-and-after photos of patients who've had similar procedures.

{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,I am a 21 year old female. Yesterday, doctors have checked my blood. I am visiting a hospital frequently as I have iron deficiency anemia. The thing I am scared about is, my doctor asked me why my ferritin has not increased (just the opposite, it has decreased from 5.79 to 5.77) after three months of taking iron supplements. My other iron levels are at 39 which has increased considering those references. But, that was probably because I did not use the medicine correctly, I was only taking 5 mg a day. Another thing I am worried about is, my lymphocytes kind of got increased in my blood: (52.8) - the reference is 19.4 to 44.9, and the other one is 3.57. My neutrophils kind of decreased too (36.9) and the reference was between 41.0 to 73.0.In the last week, I had a viral infection as both my parents were sick. Is it why my levels got high? My WBC is 6.77 and RBC is 4.52. My hemoglobin is also increasing actually, last time I checked, it was 11.0 and now it is 11.2. Still low, but it was good to see that it was increasing. My thrombocyte levels got higher again, unfortunately. The first time I was told that I was anemic, my thrombocyte levels were on 485, then in my second blood test (after using iron supplements correctly it decreased to 380. And yesterday, when I checked, it increased to 435 (reference is 156 to 373).I was also told that I have an infection in my urinary system and he gave me antibiotics. Honestly, I have been always getting suspected about it since my anemia has started. Should I be worried about my condition or is it normal?", "output": "As a doctor, there are several things I would like to address regarding your condition.\n\nFirstly, Iron deficiency anemia is most commonly due to insufficient dietary intake or absorption of iron. So even if you're taking supplements, it may take some time for the body to absorb enough to replenish stores (represented by ferritin), especially if the oral dosage isn't high enough. The standard daily dose is usually above 150 mg, from which about 5-10% is absorbed. \n\nIncreased lymphocytes (which make up part of your white blood cell count) and decreased neutrophils probably correspond with the viral infection you mentioned. It's not unusual. When your immune system fights infections, these levels can change. It's also what could cause your thrombocyte (platelet) level to be a bit higher \u2013 it's an acute phase reactant and can increase during inflammation or infection. \n\nThough the increase in thrombocyte levels stands out slightly, its association with anemia is rather non-specific. It can be increased in an inflammatory response, which may be why it was raised after your diagnosis of a urinary tract infection. However, you should note that high platelet counts might also suggest other conditions including certain cancers, so regular follow-up is important.\n\nYour RBC count and Hemoglobin levels are indeed on the low side but showing improvement, which again supports the possibility that this just needs more time given that you were only taking a small amount of iron until now.

But I heard an issue that underlying or undiagnosed thyroid issue could become a terrible one during pregnancy. Do I need to consult an endocrinologist soon? Do these fluctuations are common in hyperthyroidism?", "output": "Yes, your symptoms such as anxiety, nervousness, weight loss and fast heartbeat are consistent with an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism). Even if your most recent blood test results came back normal, with your history of having subclinical hyperthyroidism as a teenager and persistent symptoms, there could be fluctuations in the thyroid hormone levels that aren't picked up in routine testing. \n\nThyroid disorders can indeed have adverse effects on pregnancy including fertility problems, recurrent miscarriage, preterm birth, and negative impact on fetal development. Therefore, it might be a good idea to consult with an endocrinologist soon. He/she will likely order additional tests and possibly start you on medication to manage your thyroid function better. Moreover, they'll provide advice tailored to your situation for when you're trying to conceive and during pregnancy. \n\nSo while fluctuations do happen in patients with hyperthyroidism, it's still a good idea to check-in with a specialist because managing your condition aims at providing you with a consistent, balanced amount of thyroid hormone in your body to keep your symptoms at bay.

Often, they form on the side of the eye nearest to the nose. Dry eyes and exposure to dust, sun, and wind are believed to contribute to their development. \n\nThe red spot on the lacrimal caruncle may be due to irritation or allergies.

Observation for changes in size, shape, or color can be helpful, as well as for new symptoms like pain, itchiness, increased tearing, or discharge.\n\nWhile pingueculas and small irritations are usually nothing to worry about, any noticeable change in the eye should be checked out by an ophthalmologist just to be certain. Particularly if you feel persistent discomfort or observe worsening symptoms. Using over-the-counter lubricating eye drops (artificial tears) can help with dry eyes.

{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,What is HMD (hereditary macular degeneration) and what is the maximum possible impact of this disease in future on a person? Can this disease make one blind?", "output": "Hereditary Macular Degeneration (HMD), often referred to as Stargardt's Disease or Juvenile Macular Degeneration, is a genetic eye disorder that leads to progressive vision loss. It affects the macula, an area in the center of the retina responsible for sharp, central vision needed for detailed tasks such as reading, driving, and recognizing faces.\n\nHMD predominantly affects the macula, however, it can also harm other parts of the eye which results in further complications such as retinal dysfunction or even total visual loss in some extreme cases. Besides losing sharp central vision, you may also experience blurriness or haziness in your overall field of view, impaired color discrimination, and sensitivity to light.\n\nIt must be noted though that blindness due to HMD doesn't hold same significance as complete blackness or the inability to see anything at all. Most people with advanced stages of macular degeneration are considered legally blind because their vision is 20/200 or less, but they still have some peripheral or side vision remaining. \n\nThe exact prognosis varies significantly from person to person and depends on various factors like how early the condition is diagnosed, how fast it progresses, whether it affects one or both eyes, etc. Currently, there isn\u2019t a cure for HMD, but there are treatments available that can slow down its progression or help manage symptoms.

Is it worth getting a botox to stop frowning till I am healed? I am using a vitamin C and silicone scar cream to attempt better removal of hyperpigmentation. Is this a problem? I cannot tell if it is this or the creasing making it worse. I am starting to get very depressed about this scar revision. It was bad enough getting mugged and getting this wound. Now it is not healing even after a scar revision surgery. Thanks.", "output": "I'm sorry to hear about your experience and your current concerns with regards to healing after scar revision surgery. Without an in-person examination, I can't provide a definitive diagnosis. However, here are some general suggestions:\n\n1. Lines running through the scar due to frowning might contribute to the consistency of the scar because this recurrent movement could disturb the new tissue formation process. Taping may be beneficial but should be done under instructions from a healthcare professional.\n\n2. As for botox - it is an option that might help reduce facial movements during the healing process which may theoretically result in a better cosmetic outcome. This must be discussed with your surgeon or a dermatologist though, as it is not usually a part of regular post-operative care.\n\n3. Vitamin C and silicone scar creams are generally safe, and commonly used post-surgery to enhance collagen production, blend pigmentation and smooth out the appearance of scars. If you think they are causing discomfort or worsening the scar, discontinue use and consult your primary physician or plastic surgeon.\n\n4. Mental health is also important in this healing process. You might consider talking to a psychologist or counselor to address feelings of depression related to this issue.\n\nIn light of your concerns, please contact your primary physician/surgeon immediately or find a professional wound care consultant to guide you based on an in-person examination."}

But due to severe negligence and work, I could not do that. It is almost a year now, and tonight I am having a painful time. Please tell me whether there is a chance of spread of infection. Please help. My infected tooth is the right first molar of the lower jaw.", "output": "If you are experiencing severe pain a year after your dentist recommended root canal therapy, it is likely that the infection has remained or worsened. In some cases, the infection can potentially spread into your jaw bone, to other teeth, or even become systemic and affect your overall health.\n\nSymptoms of a spreading dental infection may include fever, general discomfort or illness, and swelling in your face or neck. While I can't diagnose you over online chat, I strongly recommend seeking immediate professional care if you're experiencing any of these symptoms. \n\nDon't put off scheduling an emergency appointment with your dentist. Untreated dental infections can lead to serious complications such as abscesses or sepsis, which need to be handled quickly to prevent further harm.\n\nThis doesn't mean that your case will definitely have these complications but given the severity of your pain, it's essential to seek urgent care. Please go to your dentist (or to the hospital if you experience things like high fever or facial swelling) soon because early treatment often makes a big difference."}

This often happens when a cavity is untreated and bacteria gets into the pulp of the tooth, causing inflammation and pain. The swelling in your cheek and throat could also be signs that the infection has spread.\n\nYou should seek immediate dental care. The dentist may need to perform a root canal treatment or potentially extract the tooth if it's not salvageable. Additionally, antibiotics may be required to manage the infection. Please avoid delaying this as it can lead to more severe issues such as sepsis (a body-wide infection), especially if the infection has already begun to spread. Rest assured, with proper treatment, this condition can be managed well.\n\nPlease note: If you start to experience difficulties swallowing or breathing, fever, or other serious health changes, please consider these as emergencies and visit the emergency room immediately."}

Here is the picture for your reference.", "output": "I'm an AI and being a text-based model, I can't view or analyze pictures. However, based on the symptoms you've mentioned, it sounds like your tooth decay may have progressed to where the pulp (the nerve and blood vessels) of the tooth is exposed. This generally causes pain and sensitivity. The tooth's movement comes from damage to the structure holding it in place, which could be due to severe decay. \n\nWhile it depends on the extent of the decay, if it's as advanced as you describe, rebuilding the tooth might not be an option and extraction might become necessary. It would best to visit a dentist in person to understand all possible options. They might suggest a root canal treatment too if some healthy structure is left. Regardless of the treatment method, make sure you get this checked out urgently, untreated dental issues may lead to infections or other complications."}

Again after seven days, I got a negative result after checking for pregnancy. I am getting mucus discharge in small amounts. It does not have any foul odor. Am I pregnant? Why is it showing negative?", "output": "Pregnancy tests work by detecting the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which your body starts producing after implantation of an embryo. Most home pregnancy tests won't register a positive result until around the time you would expect to get your period. If it is still negative more than a week past your missed period, it's unlikely that you're pregnant. However, varying cycle lengths and ovulation times can sometimes cause this to be misleading.\n\nThe mucus discharge you described isn't specifically a sign of early pregnancy. While cervical mucus can change during cycles and throughout pregnancies, it isn't considered one of the early signs of pregnancy, like missing a period or experiencing morning sickness.\n\nYour Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) might also play a role in an irregular menstrual cycle. PCOS can lead to hormonal imbalances that affect your cycle even when taking metformin and Macfolate.\n\nIf you did not have your periods for a month but pregnancy test still shows negative, it will be good to consult with your healthcare provider. They may do another pregnancy test, a blood test, or further investigations depending on your circumstances to figure out why you've been missing periods.

The pains are so sharp, and I can see my wisdom teeth coming out like a halfway through, it is so painful, what should I do?", "output": "Your symptoms suggest you may be experiencing pericoronitis, which is inflammation of the gum tissue around a partially emerged wisdom tooth. This condition can cause pain, swelling, difficulty chewing and biting, and sometimes even infection. I advise you to maintain good oral hygiene in order to minimize your risk of infection - brushing and flossing regularly, rinsing your mouth with warm salt water several times a day can provide some relief from the discomfort. However, these are only temporary solutions. \n\nThe definitive treatment for this problem is typically removal of the impacted wisdom teeth. It would be best to set up an appointment with a dentist or oral surgeon as soon as possible to have the area evaluated. They can determine the position and health of the wisdom teeth and recommend whether or not extraction is needed.\n    \nIn the meantime, over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen can help manage the pain. If you develop a fever, seek medical attention immediately as this could indicate an infection.

Is there any confirmatory test available to find breast cancer?", "output": "Yes, there are several additional diagnostic tests which can provide more information regarding the presence and extent of breast cancer. From what you have said, it seems like there might be some inconsistencies between the biopsy report which showed benign findings and the other test indicating stage 3 breast cancer.\n\nA second opinion or re-evaluation could be very helpful. Here are some of the tests that would be usually recommended:\n\n1. Repeat Biopsy: Given the discrepancy in the reports, it may be advisable to conduct a repeat biopsy for another histopathological examination.\n\n2. Mammography: A mammogram is an X-ray picture of the breast that can show abnormalities and detect early signs of breast cancer. In this case, doing a digital tomosynthesis (3D mammography) might give a better view of the breast tissue.\n\n3. Breast MRI: Magnetic Resonance Imaging gives a much-detailed picture of the breasts than a mammogram and helps differentiate malignant from benign tumors.\n\n4. PET/CT Scan: This is useful for checking if cancer has spread (metastasis), although it's not typically used for initial diagnosis.\n\n5. Genetic testing: Sometimes done when a strong family history of cancer exists. Some types of breast cancer are hereditary, caused by abnormal genes.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s important to remember that every patient is unique, and individual treatment plans will depend on numerous factors including age, overall health status, and specific disease characteristics.

These symptoms are also accompanied by some heaviness in the eyes. I believe this is contagious as one another family member of mine is facing the same issues.", "output": "Your mother's symptoms suggest a case of conjunctivitis, also known as \"pink eye\". Conjunctivitis can be caused by a viral or bacterial infection, an allergic reaction, or in babies an incompletely opened tear duct. It often spreads easily, especially in close contacts like families. Common symptoms include redness, itching, a gritty feeling, tearing, and a discharge which could be clear or may become thick and stringy. In addition to these, the heaviness could be because of inflammation induced by the infection or allergy.\n\nYou should ensure she gets evaluated by a healthcare provider immediately. The treatment will depend upon whether it is bacteria or virus causing the problem. Antibiotic eye drops or ointments will be prescribed if it is bacterial. Viral pink eye tends to follow its own course over 1-2 weeks, similar to a common cold. \n\nUntil then, practice good hygiene including washing hands often, not sharing towels or pillows, avoiding touching her eyes, etc., to avoid spreading the infection further. Over-the-counter eyedrops may help with symptoms, formulated for relieving itchiness and inflammation (like those containing antihistamines) might bring relief \u2013 but they won't treat the underlying cause and hence should not replace medical consultation and treatment."}

Modify computer settings: Increase text size for easier reading, adjust screen brightness and contrast.\n\nIt's also important to remember that these are only temporary solutions. If problems persist, it might indicate presbyopia (difficulty focusing on near objects), myopia (near-sightedness), or some other issue. You need to get an appointment with an optometrist for a comprehensive eye examination to rule out any medical issues. \n\nYour doctor might prescribe eyeglasses with anti-glare lenses, regular use of artificial tears if dryness is present, or recommend eye exercises.

It could potentially be related to your underlying conditions of Raynaud's phenomenon and cutaneous vasculitis. Vasculitis can certainly cause changes in the skin, including a red rash with darker center spots, which are often signs of inflammation or blocked blood vessels due to inflammation.\n\nHowever, these symptoms may also suggest other conditions similar to insect bites or stings, dermatitis, fungal infections, or even certain types of skin cancer. \n\nI would advise you to schedule an appointment with your primary care physician or a dermatologist as soon as possible for a thorough assessment.

Will doing a squint surgery be of any use? Is there anything that I can try?", "output": "Based on your description and history of injury, it seems like strabismus surgery (squint surgery) to correct the misalignment of the eyes could indeed help lessen or potentially resolve the diplopia you're experiencing. The purpose of this surgery is to align the muscles in your eye so that they can work together successfully. However, keep in mind that each patient's condition is unique and success rates may vary based on factors like severity of squint, age, previous history etc.\n\nSince prisms have not been effective for you, discussing alternate options like surgery with your ophthalmologist would be appropriate. They will perform a thorough assessment including tests such as synoptophore and prism cover test to assess the amount of deviation between your eyes. Depending on where the muscles are attached during surgery, the direction your eye points to can change. It might need more than one operation to do the trick since exact levels of adjustment sometimes require trial assessments.\n\nRemember also that continuing any recommended eye muscle exercises post-surgery will maximize success rate. Adequate recovery time after the surgery is important before going back to activities that require intense visual focus.\n\nIn addition to considering the surgery, do evaluate if anything else (e.g stress, lack of sleep), is causing the diplopia symptom to worsen.

I also have an upper molar that is broken decayed and has been like this for years. The wisdom tooth oozes green pus if you apply pressure with a cotton swab. The decayed tooth is mildly painful. I saw my dentist a few days ago, who did not seem overly concerned. She slightly cleaned the gums around the wisdom tooth and prescribed me Cephalexin and sent me on my way. I have been taking Cephalexin for a few days, and yet the tooth is still oozing. My throat is red and irritated, the gums inflamed and there is no swelling in the mouth. Also, my nostril on that side is tender and painful. I am severely worried about the infection spreading to either my heart or my brain. In fact, I read an article a few days ago about a 26 year old who died from a tooth infection spreading.I do not have a fever. I have mild nausea. It is tender on that side of my jaw.

From your description, it seems like you have a dental abscess caused by the infected wisdom tooth and possibly the decayed molar as well. Yes, untreated dental infections can potentially spread and cause serious complications, including infections in the heart or brain but those outcomes are rare and occur when infection is left untreated for extended periods of time.\n\nYou are currently on antibiotics and with good oral hygiene, the chances of this sort of spread become minimal before your scheduled oral surgery. The pus oozing from the wisdom tooth suggests that at least the abscess has an outlet preventing build-up, which is partly a positive thing. Nevertheless, continuous oozing of pus could mean an ongoing uncontrolled infection and may necessitate a change of antibiotics.\n\nClindamycin is a strong antibiotic used commonly in dental procedures especially when resistance or allergy to other antibiotics is reported. Side effects can happen with every medication, but not everyone experiences them; they tend to occur more frequently at higher doses. However, given your fear, history of heart problems, and stomach issues, it would be better to consult your healthcare provider about your fears and observations before taking Clindamycin or Zithromax again.

Antibiotics usually take a few days to start working and it can sometimes take longer depending on the type of infection. It's important to follow the instructions given by your doctor regarding medication administration. Paracetamol (Calpol) and mefenamic acid (Meftal syrup) are typically used to manage fever.\n\nHowever, I would advise against administering Meftal irrespective of the fever level. Mefenamic acid should only be used if paracetamol isn't controlling the fever adequately, or in cases of high fever as per guidance from your healthcare provider.\n\nIf the fever persists for more than 5 days or any new symptoms arise, please contact your doctor again.

Is this normal to have this much discharge so close to my past period?", "output": "Discharge can occur between periods and can be normal, depending on its consistency, color, volume, and smell. Small amounts of brown discharge can be considered normal as it's usually older blood that didn't get fully expelled during your period.\n\nHowever, large amounts of foul-smelling discharge are not common and can sometimes be a sign of certain conditions such as bacterial vaginosis (BV), trichomoniasis, or other types of infection. The bloody discharge you're experiencing now could also indicate spotting or irregular bleeding.\n\nPlease reach out to a healthcare professional for an evaluation soon. They may recommend diagnostic tests to check for infections or any underlying gynecological conditions. While waiting for an appointment, try to avoid vaginal douching, sex, or inserting anything into the vagina to prevent further irritation or potential spread of infection. \n\nRemember this advice is based on the information provided and might not fully apply to your specific health situation.

It's not uncommon to experience changes in period timing, duration, or volume after taking emergency contraceptives. Bleeding can occur within a week of pill intake and sometimes it might be heavier than usual.\n\nIf her bleeding is very heavy (soaking more than one sanitary pad per hour for several hours), if she has severe abdominal pain, or if there are any other concerns, you should seek medical attention immediately. In case the abnormal bleeding continues or other symptoms arise, I would recommend contacting a gynecologist for a physical examination and possibly an ultrasound scan to rule out any complications."}

Kindly advise.", "output": "It's very normal to feel worried after a potential exposure to HIV or any STI. In your case, you took the correct steps by using protection and getting tested afterwards.\n\nThere are a few important things to note regarding these tests:\n\n1. A p24 antigen test will detect the presence of the p24 protein which is associated with HIV. However, this initial increase could also be due to non-specific binding, directly following an acute infection. It's not clear if this increasing pattern is typical in early HIV infection since it varies person to person. \n\n2. PCR RNA tests for HIV 1 usually provide accurate results within 7-14 days post-exposure. If your test came back as not detected, this is a good sign that suggests you did not contract HIV 1 during this incident.\n\n3. An HIV 2 ELISA test can potentially give false negatives during the \"window period,\" which is up to 1-3 months after exposure. However, HIV 2 is much less common than HIV 1, especially outside of West Africa. The fact that your result was nonreactive is again a good sign.\n\nIn conclusion, while your results so far indicate you likely have not contracted either HIV 1 or 2, it would still be prudent to continue testing. Most testing protocols recommend follow up at 1 month, 3 months and possibly 6 months post-exposure. This gives enough time for antibodies to develop and be detected.

Is there anything I can do to increase their height? I want my daughter to be 5.6 tall and son to be 6 ft tall. Will giving protein powder make any difference? Kindly do the needful.", "output": "Height is primarily determined by genetics, although nutrition and overall health can play a role as well. Based on your heights, it's likely that your children will be somewhere in the same range when they're fully grown.\n\nRegarding your daughter\u2019s height at 3 years 10 months, she appears to be slightly above average for her age group according to standard growth charts. Your son seems to be within normal range for his age as well.\n\nAs for increasing their height, providing them with adequate nutrition is crucial. This includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, proteins, and dairy products. Physical activity is also important as it helps promote bone health and growth. Avoid giving protein powder without specific medical advice, as excessive protein intake can potentially harm developing kidneys, particular in young children.\n\nGiven that your daughter has had seizures and is on medication, any changes to diet should be discussed with her treating physician \u2013 particularly if it involves supplements like protein powder. It's also essential to manage her seizures properly, as uncontrolled seizures can sometimes affect growth and development.\n\nAlso remember, while it's natural for parents to want the best for their kids, being overly concerned about physical attributes may cause unnecessary stress. Encourage your children to eat healthy, stay active, do well in school, and most importantly, be happy. Exceptional height or not, they are capable of leading successful lives.\n\nTo get more personalized guidance, you can also consult with a Pediatric Endocrinologist who specializes in child growth patterns."}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,Seven years ago, I ruptured my right eardrum. I recently went to my doctor because I lost some of my hearing, and I have been having pains in my right ear. My doctor told me that the ear drum healed but there is a lot of scarring on it. Why is my eardrum hurting if it is improved?", "output": "Scarring from your previous ruptured eardrum can cause some changes to the structure and function of your ear. This scarring may lead to reduced mobility or increased stiffness of the eardrum, which can impact how well it transmits sound, resulting in hearing loss.  \n\nThe pain you're experiencing could be due to a couple different factors, even after healing has occurred. One possibility is that stiffening from the scar tissue could make the drum more sensitive to pressure changes, causing discomfort or pain especially when there are changes in atmospheric pressure like during air travel, diving or sometimes even weather changes.\n\nAnother possibility is Eustachian Tube Dysfunction (ETD). The Eustachian tube helps regulate ear pressure. When functioning suboptimally\u2014whether due to inflammation, congestion, or physical blockages\u2014you might experience symptoms such as ongoing pain/pressure, fluid build-up, and decreased hearing.\n\nFinally, the presence of scar tissue does leave your eardrum somewhat vulnerable to infection because its barrier is tougher but less flexible than it was before the rupture. If you have associated symptoms like fever, dizziness, pus discharge etc., it might suggest an active infection. \n\nTo better understand why you're having these symptoms and to get proper treatment, I recommend visiting an ENT (ear, nose and throat) specialist who can provide a thorough examination and management plan.

I went to a gastroenterologist, who did a colonoscopy and found that I had an anal fissure and internal hemorrhoid. He prescribed Sitcom Forte, Eldicet, Velgut, and Pankreoflat. He also gave me Sucralcoat Ano cream. However, every night I was in too much pain. So, early this year, I decided to consult an Ayurveda doctor who gave me some Kashayams and tablets. However, my pain did not subside. I used to evacuate the stools using my fingers. That eliminated the stools, but there was so much mucus released and extreme pain after motion. Two months ago, I went to a GP who gave me some antibiotics and painkillers for five days. During this time, I was always sleepy. I took leave from work and was always tired and fatigued. Earlier this month, I went to another GI specialist who did a sigmoidoscopy and said that it is SRUS. He said that I should not finger evacuate the stools and gave me liquid paraffin and LoX cream. Now, my current situation is that it has been three days and I am very constipated and fatigued. The pain has subsided a little. However, I am not passing stools as I used to before. After I drink water or eat something, I get a vomiting sensation. I get anxiety and panic attacks as I am scared about my condition and do not know which doctor I should consult and what I should do.

While I can't necessarily advise a specific treatment plan over the internet, I will tell you this: Chronic constipation can make an anal fissure, hemorrhoids, and Solitary Rectal ulcer Syndrome (SRUS) worse due to straining or hard stools. Conversely, these ailments can contribute to constipation as well.\n\nThe first thing is to ensure you're properly managing constipation by drinking ample amounts of water, eating high-fiber foods (such as whole grains, vegetables, fruits), regular exercise, and not delaying going to the bathroom when you feel the need. Stool softeners or fiber supplements may also be helpful in managing your symptoms. Over time, this approach should help soften the stool and decrease the need for straining, which might alleviate some of the discomfort from all three conditions. \n\nRegarding SRUS, it's indeed important to avoid digital defecation as it can exacerbate the ulcer. Using laxatives like liquid paraffin as prescribed by your doctor may aid with avoiding straining during defecation.\n\nIt's worth noting that achieving improvement with SRUS often takes time. Rest assured, while it may occasionally persist or recur, it's typically not life-threatening. It would help if you continue working with a GI specialist who has experience treating this condition - both for direct medical management and for reassurance and advice regarding any anxiety associated with your health issues.\n\nFeeling fatigued could"}

Taking the morning-after pill could provide an extra safety layer but isn't generally required if only one combined pill was missed and all other pills were taken correctly.\n\n2. The morning-after pill can reduce the risk of pregnancy by 75-89% if taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex, depending on the exact type used.\n\n3. The previously taken contraceptive pills would have likely decreased her chances of ovulation thus lowering the chance of pregnancy somewhat, however there is still a risk especially given she may be in her fertile period.\n\n4.

Unlike repairing a tire's puncture or a hole in drywall, our body cannot replace missing or stretched fascia (the firm tissue that separates the abdominal cavity from the skin and fat).\n\nConcerning climbing stairs, generally speaking, it\u2019s okay since it does not increase intra-abdominal pressure significantly. However, lifting heavy weights should be avoided as it might aggravate the situation. \n\nIt is always important to consult with your primary care physician or surgeon regarding these matters - they can give you advice specific to your health condition which an online consultation cannot provide."}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hi doctor,We are trying for a baby for three months. I have been facing a couple of issues. I feel the symptoms of periods within 18 to 20 days of my previous cycle. My regular cycle was between 25 to 28 days before. I was taking Folvite (Folic acid tablet) but started using iron tablets for two months. Please let me know what could be the cause? Or is this normal?", "output": "It seems like you might be experiencing irregular menstrual cycles, which are characterized by periods that come sooner or later than your normal 25 to 28 days cycle. This is not uncommon and can be caused by a variety of factors such as changes in body weight, eating disorders, stress, excessive exercise, certain medications including hormonal birth control, and medical conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or thyroid disorders. \n\nThe iron tablets you're taking are unlikely causing the shortening of your cycle. Iron supplementation generally doesn't impact your menstrual cycle unless you had been severely anemic before, and restoring iron levels could potentially cause some cycle regularity improvements.\n\nFolvite (folic acid) is often recommended for women trying to conceive because it helps prevent major birth defects of the baby's brain and spine.\n\nWithout more information, it\u2019s quite challenging to provide an exact reason why you're seeing these fluctuations. One thing to keep in mind is that variations in your menstrual cycle are pretty common and can occur due to minor hormonal fluctuations. However, if you are trying to get pregnant and noticing significant cycle irregularities, it may be best to consult with your healthcare provider to discuss this concern and possibly undergo fertility evaluations for both you and your partner. Your doctor could do blood tests, ultrasounds, or other diagnostic procedures to understand better why you may be having these issues."}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,I am 18 years old. I did an 8-week cycle that ended 14 days ago. The cycle consisted of applying a topical DHT gel, exactly 100 mg of pure DHT per week (15 mg per day) for eight weeks. I did it because I read that DHT could improve my puberty and increase the size of the penis. Now I am still small and feel that my hormone levels are lower. The question is could it be harmful to make another cycle or should I stop? Now, that I have stopped should I do a PCT? My wish would be to increase the penis dimensions without damaging my HPTA axis.", "output": "Firstly, it's important to understand that using high levels of hormones like dihydrotestosterone (DHT) can have serious health effects. Self-administering these hormones without proper medical supervision and understanding can lead to hormonal imbalances, changes in mood or behavior, enlarged prostate, cardiovascular problems, liver issues, and more.\n\nIt is also worth note that while DHT plays a role in the development of male secondary sexual characteristics during puberty, there is no scientific evidence that applying it topically will increase the size of your penis after natural growth has ceased.\n\nIf you feel that your hormone levels are lower, it is possible that this is due to your body compensating for the artificially high levels of DHT by cutting down its own production. This could potentially negatively impact your Hypothalamic Pituitary Testicular Axis (HPTA).\n\nAs for doing another cycle or a Post Cycle Therapy (PCT), I strongly advise against self-treatment. Misuse of these substances can cause long-term damage. Consult with a medical professional as soon as possible, ideally an endocrinologist who specializes in hormonal systems. They will help you understand any potential risks or damage to your body from your prior use of the DHT gel and guide on future measures.\n\nRemember, physical attributes such as the size of one's penis should not define your self-worth or happiness. Each individual is unique and valuable in their own right. It's essential to be informed and maintain good health than take unnecessary risks.\n"}

The pus and soreness are also indicative of a possible infection.\n\nHere's what you can do at home:\n\n1. Keep the area clean and dry. Use mild soap and warm water when washing.\n\n2. You may apply a topical antibiotic cream such as Neosporin to help prevent further infection. \n\n3. Refrain from attempting to pull or pop anything else on this area for now to avoid introducing more bacteria to the area and worsening the infection.\n\n4. You may use over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen (advil) or acetaminophen (tylenol) to manage the pain and discomfort.\n\n5. Warm compresses may provide some relief and stimulate healing by increasing blood flow to the area. Do this 3-4 times a day for about 15 minutes each time. \n\n6.

How can I stop it?", "output": "It sounds like you're suffering from allergic rhinitis or sinusitis, possibly due to exposure to dust at your workplace - this condition can lead to nasal congestion and imbalance of pressure in your inner ear, causing dizziness. Here are some things you might consider:\n\n1. Avoid triggers: Try to reduce your exposure to dust as much as possible.\n\n2. Hygiene: Wash your hands often to prevent infections.\n\n3. Nasal rinse: Consider using a saline nasal spray or rinse to help reduce congestion and remove allergens.\n\n4. Medication: Over the counter antihistamines may be helpful for reducing symptoms, and nasal steroid sprays could also decrease inflammation within your sinuses.\n\n5. Immunotherapy: If allergies are found to be the cause, immunotherapy (allergy shots) might be recommended by a specialist. \n\n6.

The symptoms you describe such as swelling, general body pain, fatigue, and mild sweating at times can all be signs of an allergy. \n\nIn some cases, people can also develop reactions over time, even after having used a medication multiple times without issue. It\u2019s important for her to avoid taking this medication moving forward until she talks to her doctor about alternatives.\n\nAnother possibility could be that she has developed Hypothyroidism, which is when the thyroid gland doesn't produce enough thyroid hormone. Symptoms of hypothyroidism can include fatigue, weakness, and joint or muscle pain. However, other causes should be ruled out first through further medical investigation.\n\nAs her blood test results showed something abnormal in her thyroid, she would likely need further evaluation for any thyroid disorders too.

Prolonged screen use can sometimes cause digital eye strain which might be responsible for certain symptoms. However, it's also important to rule out serious conditions that could include vascular abnormalities in the brain.\n\nThe sensation of an 'electrical rush' can be experienced differently by everyone and is subjective, hence making it a bit challenging to narrow down its exact cause without additional information. \n\nGiven your symptoms, I'd recommend that you seek immediate medical attention. Your doctor will likely perform a physical exam, ask about your health history, and potentially order imaging/tests such as an MRI or CT scan to check for any structural problems. Also, consulting with a neurologist and/or ENT specialist may provide further answers.

{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,Can a CT scan identify liver metastasis?", "output": "Yes, a CT scan can identify liver metastases. Computed tomography (CT) provides detailed images of the body and can be used to detect liver metastases or secondary cancerous growths in the liver, often from cancers that originated elsewhere in the body. However, it's important to note that while CT scans are effective, they might not catch very small tumors less than 1 cm in size. In addition, other imaging techniques like MRI, PET scans or ultrasound may be used along with CT scans for more detailed evaluation. Biopsy is usually required for final confirmation of metastasis because imaging tests are not always definitive."}

I would like to emphasize that recovery from PPCM can be very variable, depending on factors such as how severe the disease is at diagnosis, response to therapy and other individual health factors.\n\nAn ejection fraction (EF) of 38% is indicative of mild to moderately reduced heart function; normal EF is typically between 55% -70%. However, you mentioned her heart function has been assessed as \"normal\", which may suggest she's responding well to treatment or perhaps it refers to other aspects of heart function other than just EF.\n\nThe fact that she is already on medications indicates an appropriate course of action by her doctors. These drugs help control symptoms and prevent further deterioration of heart function. Diuretics remove excess fluid buildup, whereas beta blockers help slow down heart rate and reduce blood pressure, reducing workload on the heart.\n\nThe timing of recovery in cases of PPCM varies significantly.

However, for anyone facing PTSD, depression, and anxiety, treatment usually involves a combination of psychotherapy (talking therapy) and medication.\n\nPsychotherapy may involve cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which helps alter thought patterns leading to negative feelings, or Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR), which is specifically used for PTSD patients. Other forms of therapies like exposure therapy could also be beneficial for PTSD. \n\nMedications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are often prescribed for these conditions too. These include drugs such as fluoxetine and sertraline.\n\nFurther support from self-help groups and/or mindfulness strategies like meditation can help support overall mental resilience.\n\nHowever, it is vital that the individual seek out specific medical advice from health care providers with experience in managing these complex conditions.

But, the doctor has told to get DNA test that is an NIPT test. Is it important? If level 1 and the double marker are fine then DNA and NIPT test should also be fine right?", "output": "As a doctor, I am here to advise that the NIPT (Non-Invasive Prenatal Test) is a highly accurate screening test that can be done early in pregnancy. It's significant because it detects chromosomal disorders including Down syndrome, Edwards syndrome and Patau syndrome which cannot be detected through level one scan or double marker tests. \n\nWhile the results of your wife's level one scan and double marker are reassuring, these tests do not screen for all genetic abnormalities. Basically, level 1 ultrasound evaluates the anatomy of the fetus, placenta, and uterus and Double Marker test screens for Down\u2019s syndrome (trisomy 21) and Edwards\u2019 syndrome (trisomy 18). But NIPT gives additional information about other rare chromosomal numbers.\n\nYour can choose not to take the test if you feel confident with just the earlier screening results. However, it provides extra reassurance and knowledge about your baby\u2019s health, especially considering your wife's age. The risk of having a child with a chromosomal abnormality increases as the mother's age increases.\n\nIn general, though ,there's a high likelihood that if the first two tests were fine, NIPT will also not show any problems but we can't guarantee with certainty without taking the test.\nAlways make sure to discuss this with your healthcare provider who knows your medical history well before making a decision."}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,I was suffering from minor Achilles tendinopathy and visited a physiotherapist today to get it checked.

I have my exams tomorrow which I have to get to and other events on the weekend where I have to be (and will involve walking). I am worried about how I can see as I cannot walk at all. Is it normal to experience such pain after deep tissue massage to tight calf muscles, or did I sustain some injury (say a muscle strain or something similar) and need to get it checked out?", "output": "Deep tissue massage can indeed produce discomfort and sometimes even pain afterwards, especially if the tissues were very tight or knotty. This is because deep tissue massage involves applying firm pressure and slow strokes to reach deeper layers of muscle and fascia (the connective tissue surrounding muscles). Hence, some tenderness or soreness post-massage is expected, particularly after your first session.\n\nHowever, sharp pains while walking might be a bit more than what one would normally expect from simple post-massage soreness. You could have potentially sustained a minor strain. Rest, ice, compression, and elevation are generally good steps to manage most minor musculoskeletal injuries in their acute phase.\n\nI would suggest you to continue icing it and take over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medication like ibuprofen, if it's safe for you. Try passive gentle stretching exercises too. However, if things don't improve within 24 hours or if your pain worsens, I recommend you get in touch with your physiotherapist again. If that's not possible, please consult another healthcare provider, possibly urgent care if available, especially given your need to be mobile for exams and events.\n\nIn the meantime, use aids like a cane or crutch if needed to help reduce stress on the painful area while walking, provided you've been shown how to correctly use these tools. Avoid vigorous activity or anything that increases the pain too much. Your recovery will guide your return to full activities.\n  \nAgain, this advice is based on the information provided"}

Gradually forming granulation tissue can sometimes look like a white or grayish substance. Given you had your wisdom teeth removed just last week, and because it's not easily movable, it might be granulation tissue which is part of the normal healing process after extraction. However, if you feel discomfort or suspect infection (such as bad taste, pain, swelling), please do return to your oral surgeon or dentist for an evaluation.\n\nAs for the small red area on the gums, this could simply be irritation possibly due to plaque build-up or brushing technique especially given its front location on the second molar. If it doesn't resolve in a few days, or if it grows or becomes painful, consult your dentist as it may indicate gum inflammation, called gingivitis, or other dental issues.\n\nTo help with the feeling of plaque buildup, salt water rinses a few times a day can help provide gentle cleaning without irritating the surgical sites. Try to avoid using any instruments like toothpicks near the surgical site to prevent injury. \n\nKeep up with your regular hygiene routine while being cautious around the extraction sites. This should allay some of these concerns, but definitely report any changes or worsening symptoms to your doctor or dentist."}

Nutritional support: Ensure you have a balanced and healthy diet filled with fruits, vegetables, proteins, and essential vitamins and minerals. In particular, Vitamin A, B-vitamins, Vitamin C, D, E, Iron, Selenium, and Zinc are crucial for hair health.\n\n2. Avoid heat and chemicals: Excessive usage of harsh hair products, heating tools, and chemical treatments could damage your hair and exacerbate hair fall.\n\n3. Don't pull or twist your hair: Tight hairstyles that pull on your hair (like tight ponytails) can also cause hair fall.\n\n4. Manage stress: Engage in regular exercise, meditation or yoga - anything that helps bring down your stress levels.\n\n5. Health review: Sometimes, hair loss can be symptomatic of an underlying medical issue like thyroid disease, anemia etc. So it would be wise to get yourself checked by your primary care physician if the hair loss continues despite taking these measures.\n\nIf after altering some lifestyle habits, including improving your diet and managing stress better, you don't notice an improvement, I recommend seeing a dermatologist who specializes in hair loss issues. They may recommend specific treatments like minoxidil (Rogaine), finasteride (Propecia) or other treatments based on your diagnosis."}

My transferrin saturation, and total iron levels are low but hemoglobin is fine. Kindly advice.", "output": "Low transferrin saturation and total iron levels generally indicate iron deficiency, which might result in anemia if not managed properly. But your hemoglobin level is still normal, which suggests that the iron deficiency has not yet affected your red blood cell production.\n\nMethotrexate, which you are taking for psoriasis, can cause various side effects including liver damage, lung problems, low white blood cell counts, and others. Although it's rare, Methotrexate can affect the absorption or utilization of nutrients like iron in some cases, possibly contributing to lower iron levels. Nonetheless, other possible causes of iron deficiency may include dietary inadequacy, blood loss, malabsorption conditions like celiac disease, etc.\n\nTo address the underlying issue, we need to identify the cause. It would be beneficial to review your diet, checking for potential gastrointestinal issues (e.g., bleeding), and ensuring that Methotrexate isn't causing harm to your digestive system. \n\nI suggest scheduling an appointment with a healthcare provider to discuss these results further. They might consider modifying your treatment for Psoriasis if they suspect Methotrexate could have contributed to the low iron outcomes.

It is unlikely that herpes 2 is causing these symptoms since it typically results in painful blister-like lesions on or around the genitals and not the type of widespread pain you're describing.\n\nOne possibility is a condition called epididymitis which is inflammation of the tube at the back of the testicle that stores and carries sperm which can cause discomfort and swelling in the testicles. This can occur due to various reasons including bacterial infections (sometimes sexually transmitted ones like chlamydia or gonorrhea though you mentioned being tested for STDs), urine backflow into the epididymes, or even physical strain.\n\nHowever, considering your history of two hernia surgeries, post-hernia surgery complications can't be ruled out. The mesh used in certain surgeries may lead to ongoing discomfort or chronic pain that radiates through the groin area, lower abdomen and sometimes thighs as well. Sometimes such mesh can adhere or abrade nearby tissues causing similar pain.\n\nImpotence can result from psychological stress (such as anxiety about contracting an STD), pelvic pain, medication side-effects (like Neurontin), or other conditions such as poor blood flow linked to cardiovascular disease or nerve-related problems. \n\nIt's important that you see a urologist regarding these concerns. They might suggest imaging tests such as ultrasound or CT scan combined with physical examination and possibly microbiological culture or antibiotic sensitivity tests depending upon their initial diagnosis.

I am a male, 36 years old, 6'2\", 190 lbs. I have no medical issues or past history of kidney problems or cancer. Can it be due to STD?", "output": "Hello, while it's true that some sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) can cause hematuria (the presence of blood in the urine), they aren't typically the primary cause. Other more common causes include urinary tract infections, kidney stones, and injuries to the urinary tract.\n\nHowever, since your symptoms are not entirely specific and could be caused by a variety of conditions, you should seek medical attention immediately. Hematuria is always something that requires clinical evaluation. Your doctor will probably run some tests including urinalysis, urine cultures, or imaging studies to identify the source of the problem.\n\nRemember all advice provided here should not replace an actual visit to a health professional. Please set up an appointment with your healthcare provider as soon as possible."}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,My foreskin of the penis is tight. Is there any problem in the future during sex? My age is 20 years, male, and single.", "output": "Having a tight foreskin is a condition known as phimosis. In its mild form, it usually poses no problems and sex can be performed without pain or discomfort for both partners.\n\nHowever, if the tightness of your foreskin is causing you pain during erection, difficulties with urination, recurrent infections, or other symptoms, it might be an issue in terms of sexual health and hygiene. Such conditions may make intercourse painful or difficult and sometimes lead to tearing and subsequent bleeding of the foreskin tissue which could possibly affect your sexual experience or performance.\n\nIf these symptoms are persistent, it's recommended that you see a doctor, who might suggest use of topical steroid creams to help loosen the skin or potentially a surgical procedure such as circumcision depending on the severity of your condition. \n\nFinally, remember this: self-diagnosis is not advisable. It's always safer to consult a healthcare professional personally about your concerns."}

Could people with minor beta thalassemia also get iron deficiency anemia? Knowing that I get heavy cycles and my diet is very poor.", "output": "Minor beta thalassemia trait often doesn't cause any symptoms because the body makes enough normal hemoglobin, but you are describing common symptoms of iron deficiency anemia. Heavy periods and inadequate diet can definitely lead to a lack of iron in your body, which in turn may trigger iron deficiency anemia. This is due to reduced iron intake from food or excessive loss of iron through menstruation.\n\nTherefore, even though you have minor beta thalassemia, you could still develop iron deficiency anemia because these conditions affect different proteins in the red blood cells. However, it's important to not self-diagnose \u2013 especially considering your existing condition of thalassemia.\n\nI recommend that you contact a healthcare provider who can do appropriate testing, like a blood test to check your ferritin levels which indicate your body's iron stores. They will give you advice tailored specifically to your situation, including how best to manage your diet or if iron supplements might be necessary. Also, further evaluation might be needed for other possible reasons behind your anemia like Vitamin B12 or folate deficiency. In some cases, consulting with a hematologist (blood specialist) may also be helpful.\n"}

After taking Ipill period comes as per regular cycle for 4 days but next period only one two hours bleeding and then stopped. This month period is skipped till date say it late by 25 day including today. Do I need to visit doctor or wait?", "output": "Your concerns are quite understandable. The menstrual cycle can be affected by numerous factors, including stress, use of hormonal contraception like emergency contraceptive pills (such as Ipill), and other health issues.\n\nThe iPill works primarily by preventing ovulation and is most effective when used correctly. However, no method is 100% guaranteed, and it does not continue to protect you from subsequent unprotected sex.\n\nEven if there was 'no leakage or injection of sperm', there's always a possibility for pregnancy if you had intercourse without contraceptives as the pre-ejaculate fluid could contain some sperm. \n\nTaking the iPill may cause changes in your period - it can become lighter, heavier, earlier or later than expected. This does explain your situation to some degree. However, missing a period after taking the pill isn't typical and may warrant medical evaluation especially with three negative pregnancy tests. \n\nUnfortunately, I can't provide an exact diagnosis based on this information alone. It might be a result of using such hormonal pills or could be due to underlying conditions like Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS).\n\nI would suggest scheduling an appointment with a gynecologist as soon as possible. They can help determine why your periods have become irregular and whether any further action is needed. Please don't delay seeking medical assistance due to uncertainties or fears; it's important to take care of your sexual and reproductive health. Finally, make sure to discuss reliable forms of regular birth control with your healthcare provider.\n"}

Is there any chance to cure it without any permanent glasses and without any operations. Suggest me, please.", "output": "I'm sorry to hear about your situation. As a doctor, based on your description it seems you may have a condition called Amblyopia (lazy eye) or another congenital eye disorder. Treating such conditions typically depends on the exact diagnosis and severity. Often times glasses, contact lenses or surgery are needed.\n\nHowever, there are some instances in which vision therapy, under the direction of an eye specialist, can be helpful. Vision therapy is like physical therapy for the visual system, including the eyes and parts of the brain that control vision. This therapy involves a series of exercises performed directly with a vision therapist over weeks to months. \n\nPlease consult with an ophthalmologist or optometrist for an accurate assessment and treatment options suitable for your condition. An exact diagnosis is crucial before starting any type of therapy.\n\nAlso remember that lifestyle changes, such as maintaining a good diet, regular exercise and avoiding strain on your eyes by decreasing screen time, can help maintain overall eye health."}

Is this an STD?", "output": "Based on your description and the fact that you're currently dealing with chicken pox, it's likely that the lesions on your scrotum and outer genitals are also from chicken pox. Chicken pox is a viral infection that results in the eruption of an itchy rash and fluid-filled blisters over the body, and this can include the genital area as well.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that other illnesses like STDs can also cause lesions on the genitals. If you have been sexually active and believe there's a chance you could have contracted an STD, you should consider getting tested for peace of mind and to ensure proper treatment. \n\nMoreover, self-diagnosis isn't always accurate, and if the symptoms persist or worsen, please arrange for a physical examination with your healthcare provider.\n"}

Took six different brands, etc. Pregnancy tests are all negative. What could be causing this late period? I am under a lot of stress also.", "output": "A late or missed menstrual period can be caused by several factors other than pregnancy. Given what you've described in your situation, the following could be possibilities:\n\n1. The use of antibiotics such as a Z pack (Azithromycin) might influence your menstrual cycle, although this is relatively rare. It's more likely that illness itself can throw off your cycle.\n \n2. High levels of stress can certainly impact the regularity of your menstrual cycle. Stress affects the hypothalamus, which is responsible for regulating your hormones including those that control your menstrual cycle.\n\n3. Sudden changes in weight, either loss or gain, intense exercise, and metabolic disorders like diabetes or thyroid disease are common causes of irregular periods. \n\n4. Hormonal contraceptives may lead to small amounts of bleeding or no period at all.\n\n5. Conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), premature ovarian failure or perimenopause can cause fluctuations in cycle length.\n\nIf your test results continue to indicate you're not pregnant and your period doesn't return soon, it would be wise to follow up with your healthcare provider for further evaluation. With consideration of your medical history and possibly additional laboratory investigations, they would be able to provide a more precise answer.\n"}

Lately, I have been experiencing severe mood swings and have not been myself. One minute I am dancing around the room and could not be happier, the next I am either crying or very angry. Normally, I do not cry and I am usually pretty laid back. I have also been getting dizzy mostly when I stand up or walk up the stairs. I have trouble sleeping and or sleeping too much. I am hungry all the time, however, when I do eat I feel nausea. I have done some research and have found that these symptoms are both common with the injection and also with pregnancy. How do I tell, if these are pregnancy symptoms or if it is because of the Depo shot? I did miss my last shot three months ago. Last month I took a home pregnancy test it came back negative. Will a home test be enough to tell if I am pregnant or not?", "output": "The symptoms you're experiencing could indeed be related to Depo-Provera or possible pregnancy. However, they could also be signs of other conditions such as low blood pressure or anemia, especially with the dizziness and mood swings.\n\nRegarding your question on pregnancy testing, home pregnancy tests are usually quite accurate, but there is still a chance for it to give a false-negative result (test negative despite being pregnant) especially if tested too early after a missed period. If you're uncertain, it's best to go to a healthcare provider for further tests, like a blood hCG test, which can detect pregnancies earlier than home urine tests.\n\nAnyway, given that you've also missed a dose of your contraception, this does increase the likelihood of unexpected pregnancy. It would be prudent to re-test using a highly sensitive home pregnancy kit or consult your doctor.\n\nAlso, since your symptoms aren't typical for you and are causing distress, I strongly encourage you to seek medical attention. This would not only help rule out pregnancy but also any other underlying health issue that may need treatment."}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,I had stomach pain after which my report was confirmed as gallbladder stones. What is the further procedure? Please let me know all the details, including the cost.", "output": "Hello, the next steps after confirming gallbladder stones (cholelithiasis) depend on several factors like the size and number of stones, whether or not you have symptoms, and your overall health status. \n\nPrimarily, gallstones that don't produce symptoms often don't need any immediate treatment other than monitoring by a doctor. However, if you're experiencing stomach pain as you previously mentioned, then it's likely symptomatic gallstones which may require more assertive action.\n\nHere are the different main strategies:\n\n1. **Medication**: Certain medications can dissolve gallstones, but this method works only with small cholesterol stones and might take months to years to completely erase them. This approach tends to be least effective in most cases. It also doesn't prevent new stones from forming.\n\n2. **Surgery (Cholecystectomy)**: This is a surgery to remove the gallbladder. The most common procedure used these days is Laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Surgery eliminates the gallstones and the possibility of other stones developing in the future. The downside is that you can live without a gallbladder; its absence doesn't affect your ability to digest food, but it can cause diarrhea in some people.\n\n3. **ERCP (Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography)**: A chemical is injected into the bile duct to dissolve the stone if it has moved from the gallbladder to any of the bile ducts.\n\nAs for the costs,"}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,My 24 days newborn son is suffering from midgut malrotation. Is this a problem?", "output": "Yes, midgut malrotation is a serious health condition that typically impacts infants. This disorder refers to an abnormality in the position of the intestines due to improper rotation during fetal development. It can cause various digestive problems and if it leads to a volvulus (twisting of the intestine), it can cut off blood supply to part of the gut causing a life-threatening situation known as intestinal ischemia or necrosis.\n\nSymptoms commonly include bilious vomiting (green vomit) though symptoms can vary in intensity from very severe to mild or subtle. Other possible symptoms may range from bloating and pain to failure to thrive or no symptoms at all.\n\nIt's important that you monitor your baby closely and ensure he receives medical care. Most often, surgery is required to correct this issue. The circumstances will dictate whether emergency surgery is required or if it can be planned electively. Regardless, survival rates post-surgery for this disorder are high, although long-term gastric challenges are common. Interdisciplinary follow-up care with pediatric gastroenterologists and surgeons is key.\nStill, navigating a child's serious health condition is never easy, so do take care of yourself too while supporting your newborn.

MRCP report says everything is alright but neither serum bilirubin nor yellowness has got less.", "output": "In your case, it seems that while the physical obstruction has been dealt with during ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangio-Pancreatography), the bilirubin levels are still high. There can be several reasons:\n\n1. Recovery Time: After ERCP, it may take some time for bilirubin levels to decrease, especially if they were exceptionally high at first. The body needs to metabolize and eliminate the excess bilirubin in the system.\n\n2. Persistent Obstruction or Difficulty Draining Bile: Sometimes, small stones or sludge could have been missed or might not have been entirely cleared out, leading to persistent higher bilirubin levels. The MRCP report says everything is normal, which means there must not any significant obstruction visible at that point in time.\n\n3. Damage to Liver Function: If hepatitis, alcohol abuse, or other diseases have damaged the liver's ability to metabolize and excrete bilirubin, levels may remain high despite relieving the physical obstruction.\n\n4. Hemolysis: An increased rate of breakdown of red blood cells can lead to higher bilirubin levels.\n\n5. Post Hepatic Jaundice: There could be issues with the substances in the liver that bind, process and transport bilirubin into bile that aren't related to physical obstructions which an ERCP would resolve.\n\nGiven the complexity, you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor who has access to your complete medical history and investigations"}

However, the symptom of coughing when inserting an earbud suggests reflex cough which can be seen in certain conditions like Eustachian tube irritation.\n\nIt's always a good idea to see an ENT specialist when experiencing persistent ear discomfort. They can accurately diagnose your issue and recommend appropriate treatment. Using ear drops without medical prescription may not help and could potentially worsen your condition if not appropriate for your specific situation. \n\nIn the meantime, until your appointment, avoid using earbuds or any kind of sharp objects in your ears as they can cause more harm than good.

Please note that your pediatrician should be the one guiding all changes to your infant's formula and feeding regimen, given both their prematurity and the issues they're currently having.\n\nFirstly, do not worry about slight differences in the pace at which your twins are growing. It's common for children, even multiples, to grow at different rates. \n\nRegarding the milk intake, it's good to monitor but remember it's absolutely fine if babies don't finish feedings, or want to eat more than usual. They\u2019ll have some meals where they're hungrier or thirstier than others. Premature babies often take smaller volumes more frequently than full term babies because of their small stomachs.\n\nAs for constipation and gas issues, please understand this is also a quite common problem, especially in formula-fed babies who may struggle with digesting certain proteins in certain formulas. All formulas should essentially have all required nutrients, so brand switching alone may not make much of a difference unless specifically recommended by your pediatrician.\n\nFirst and foremost, I suggest you relay these concerns to the baby's pediatrician who may want to examine the child, potentially considering modifying her feeding schedule (smaller volume more frequently) or adjusting the concentration of her feeds slightly before simply switching products entirely. This could ease digestion struggles as well. Additionally, gentle exercises like cycling the legs can sometimes help with constipation and gas. \n\nPlease consult with your pediatrician and follow his/her instructions"}

What should I do?", "output": "Infant fever after vaccination is a common side effect of many vaccines, but it should subside within 24 hours. Persistent fever or change in feeding habits may indicate an infection or other illness. It's important to maintain hydration and nutrition for your baby.\n\nYou should consult your pediatrician as soon as possible, especially if the reduced intake has lasted two or more days without improvement. This can result in dehydration which is often dangerous in infants. Until you are able to contact your paediatrician, continue trying to breastfeed during calm times and when your child seems most comfortable. If formula feeding, remember to make sure the formula milk is not too hot.\n\nAdditionally, monitor your baby's wet diapers - this will give us an idea about her hydration status. Infants typically have six or more soaked diapers per day, so fewer could mean they're not getting enough fluids. Fever may also cause increased fluid demands. \n\nRemember, when in doubt with an infant, always err on the side of caution and reach out to your physician or seek emergency medical attention.

Thank you in advance for your help.", "output": "Though it's possible to be re-infected with Chlamydia after treatment if exposed, the antibiotic you were prescribed for your UTIs, nitrofurantoin, is not typically effective against Chlamydia. The Chlamydia bacterium usually requires different antibiotics such as azithromycin or doxycycline.\n\nIf you were correctly treated for Chlamydia 8 years ago (assuming you took all of the medication as prescribed), you should have been cleared of the infection. However, a reinfection could have occurred if your partner was not effectively treated, even if his test came back negative later on. Chlamydia can sometimes present asymptomatically, meaning without symptoms, especially in men.\n\nAn unresolved Chlamydia infection could cause recurring urinary tract infections, but these cases are very rare. Most often, frequent UTIs are caused by issues such as an abnormal urinary tract structure, diabetes, or changes due to menopause in women.\n\nIt would be prudent to go ahead and get tested for Chlamydia given your previous history and current symptoms\u2014even if only to rule out that potential diagnosis\u2014and follow up with your physician regarding your recurrent UTIs.

I did a urine test and another ultrasound. Torsion was ruled out once again. When the pain flared up again, I went to the doctor back. Again, I did an ultrasound, urine test, and blood test. Torsion and infection were ruled once again.The doctor pointed out a little bit of fluid around my testicle, and I had no pain. But, still, I have pain in my testicle. What was ruled out with these tests? From where does the pain arises?", "output": "The tests that were done would have ruled out testicular torsion (a condition where the spermatic cord that provides blood flow to the testicle is twisted), infection, and likely any masses or tumors due to the ultrasound. It's good news those conditions were ruled out as they can be serious.\n\nThe fluid around your testicle you mentioned could be a hydrocele or possibly a varicocele, both of which are fairly common in men. Hydrocele is an accumulation of serous fluid in a body cavity while varicocele is an enlargement of the veins within the scrotum. Both can cause discomfort but are often not dangerous.\n\nHowever, if your pain continues, it could also potentially be due to something like epididymitis (inflammation of the tube at the back of the testicle that carries sperm), or other non-testicular causes such as hernias or even referred pain from other locations like lower-back problems. \n\nAnother possibility can be a condition called intermittent testicular torsion where the testicle twists and then untwists itself spontaneously. This can cause severe on-and-off type pain similar to what you're describing. \n\nRemember, persistent testicular pain should always be evaluated by a healthcare provider because it can be a symptom of serious conditions. You may need more specialized tests or visit a urologist for further consultation."}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hi doctor,I got an accident before a month. I got a right knee ACL ligament type 2 tear. Is it possible for the type 2 ligament to get cured by itself without operation and if so, how many days does it take to heal?", "output": "The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) has a limited ability to heal itself due to its location and lack of blood supply. A grade 2 sprain represents an incomplete tear of the ACL, which may cause instability of the knee, discomfort, and limitation in certain activities.\n\nWhile conservative treatments such as physical therapy can sometimes manage these symptoms effectively, depending on your age, health condition, physical activities, and personal goals, a surgical route might be necessary to restore full function to your knee for high-intensity sports or strenuous labor.\n\nNon-surgical treatment usually involves rehabilitation programs aimed at restoring joint movement and strength. This could take weeks to months, depending on how diligent you are with therapy and how your body responds.\n\nSurgery often leads to more predictable outcomes regarding knee stability and is especially useful for active individuals. However, it also comes with potential risks including infection, bleeding, blood clots, and anesthesia complications.\n\nTherefore, I would recommend discussing this with your orthopedic surgeon who can review your imaging studies, examine your knee, discuss your individual needs, and determine the best course of action for you. Always consult with your healthcare provider directly when making decisions regarding your health care."}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hi doctor,I am a 30 year old female. I have a minor issue. About a month and a half ago, there was an incident where the condom broke. About 36 hours later, my husband got me four of the morning-after pills, and I took them all at once. Three days later, I started experiencing nausea, soreness of the breasts, lower back as well as abdominal pain, frequent urination, and tiredness. This carried on for almost a week. I then noticed a light brown discharge. And, from the next day, I bled for six days. I usually bleed for seven days. After my periods, I still had the symptoms.Nearly a month later, I got my periods again, but on the first day I had severe cramps and used a tampon. On the third day, there was a slight discharge which was brown in color. On the fourth day, there was some bleeding, but not at night. Today would be day five, and I still do not see blood. My main concern is that my vagina feels different. It is more firm than usual and feels tight. I sometimes feel a pulling sensation. Could it be due to the morning-after pills? I did home pregnancy tests, and it came back negative. It has been a month and 18 days now, since the intercourse.", "output": "Hi, I appreciate that dealing with these unfamiliar symptoms can be concerning. Firstly, the morning-after pill (also known as an emergency contraceptive) has many side effects which include nausea, breast tenderness, abdominal pain, fatigue, and changes in menstrual cycle - so what you might have experienced could very well have been due to it. The brown discharge you noticed is likely old blood being expelled from your body; this is also common after taking the morning-after pill.\n\nThe feelings of tightness and \"pulling\" sensation in your vagina may be related to a variety of factors\u2014hormonal changes, stress, certain medications can all affect how your vagina feels. However, if these symptoms persist or worsen, you should definitely consult a healthcare provider who can properly evaluate you through a check-up and possibly further testing. \n\nLastly, the negative result on your pregnancy test is encouraging, especially since it's been more than a month since possible conception. Home pregnancy tests are very accurate when taken correctly and at the right time. It's best to take them one week after missing your period. Since you have had two cycles now post the incident, the chances of you being pregnant are extremely low given the negative test results. \n\nPlease make sure to get regular gynecological examinations and discuss any future plans for contraception to ensure safe sex practices henceforth."}

I was put on an elimination diet but the hives are still there. I occasionally get angioedema with it also. Can angiodema cause anaphylaxis? As you can see I am so scared for my throat to close up that I am scared to eat anything. I have only been eating a couple of things daily and live off that.", "output": "I understand your concern. A RAST test (Radioallergosorbent Test) often has a good degree of accuracy, but it is not perfect. Results can be affected by certain factors like the amount of allergen exposure prior to testing and presence of other medical conditions.\n\nYes, the foods you've tested positive for could potentially cause anaphylaxis but the likelihood could vary greatly depending on how severe your reaction to these respective items is. Class 1 and 2 scores indicate a lower level of sensitivity compared with higher classes; that being said, even lower class scores should not be dismissed without caution as they still indicate an allergic reaction. \n\nUrticaria (hives) may persist despite dietary elimination if there are non-allergic causes at play such as physical stimulus (heat, cold, pressure), autoimmune disorder, infection etc. Angioedema can occur along with urticaria and although it can occasionally precede anaphylaxis, it doesn't always do so.\n\nIt's very important in your case to have medications like antihistamines on hand and also an epinephrine autoinjector for more severe reactions. \n\nKeeping a food diary can help to decipher additional food triggers as well. You might want to consult with a dietitian who specializes in food allergies to make sure you're getting adequate nutrition given your current food restrictions.\n\nRemember, immediate medical attention is needed if anaphylactic symptoms such as difficulty breathing or swallowing develop. \n\nYou ultimately need"}

I take Immunace Forte after lunch and Libotryp at bedtime. So, why are my periods not regular? Is this a side effect of my medicine or could it be due to a disease? Recently, I was also prescribed Uprise-D3 (60000) once a month for six months. My recent 25-OH vitamin D total is 21.1 ng/mL. I also have sudden weight gain. My weight in the last one and a half years increased from 57 kg to 81 kg. I also have a chronic nose block.", "output": "Irregular periods can be caused by many factors, including significant weight gain and certain medical conditions like tuberculosis or hormonal imbalances. Particularly, abnormal levels of thyroid hormone or prolactin could lead to menstrual irregularities. The medicine you are taking (Libotryp) could also potentially cause changes in your menstruation as it affects levels of serotonin in the body.\n\nMoreover, substantial weight gain over a short period of time, like what you experienced, can have a strong impact on your hormones which regulate menstruation cycles. It's common for women who are overweight to experience irregular periods due to increased production of estrogen by fat cells.\n\nTurner's syndrome or Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) are some diseases that can also induce such symptoms. However, there isn't enough information here to make such diagnoses \u2014 further investigations would need to be done.\n\nI strongly recommend discussing these symptoms with your healthcare provider as soon as possible for a thorough evaluation. This may involve blood tests to check hormone levels and likely an ultrasound to evaluate your ovaries and uterus. Also, keep tracking your menstrual cycles, noting any irregularities. Doing so can provide crucial information when you see a doctor. In the meantime, maintain balanced nutrition and regular exercise which could help manage the weight issue as well.\n"}

Currently, I have an issue of hair fall and mild body aches.", "output": "Hello, I'm sorry to hear about your symptoms. As a doctor, it's important for me to let you know that the symptoms you're experiencing can potentially be linked to your thyroid condition. Thyroid hormones are crucial for many body functions including hair growth. Hypothyroidism (low thyroid hormone levels) or changes in hormone levels during and after pregnancy can sometimes cause hair loss.\n\nAlso, thyroid disease is known to cause body aches and muscle pain in some people. However, those symptoms could also be due to other reasons too like lack of adequate rest, nutritional deficiencies, stress etc.\n\nAs you had a history of thyroid issues before pregnancy, postpartum thyroiditis, which occurs in 5-10% of women who have been pregnant, may happen. In this condition, the thyroid gets inflamed within the first year after childbirth and this inflammation can last up to 18 months.\n\nYou should contact your healthcare provider and relay these symptoms. They can adjust your treatment plan as needed. They may recommend testing your thyroid function with blood tests to guide the management. Take care.\n"}

And all NABL and CAP labs are of same quality? Please explain in detail.", "output": "Yes, laboratories accredited by NABL (National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories) in India and CAP (College of American Pathologists) in the U.S. are generally trustworthy in terms of reliability and accuracy of their test results. These accreditations indicate that a laboratory meets certain internationally accepted standards of quality control, proficiency testing, personnel qualifications, and operational practices.\n\nNABL is an internationally recognized accreditation body from India. It follows ISO 15189, which is specifically designed to ensure medical lab competence. Similarly, CAP is considered one of the global leaders in laboratory quality assurance, advocating high-quality patient care, and provides inter-laboratory comparisons to assist labs improve their diagnostic competencies.\n\nHowever, it is important to understand that while these certifications mean a lab has met specific requirements at the time of inspection, that does not necessarily mean all NABL and/or CAP accredited labs offer the same exact level of service or accuracy and precision in every single case. Just like in any other area of healthcare, variability can exist; different labs might have different areas of expertise, use different methodologies, and even within these certified labs, human errors can occur.\n\nRegular internal audits, periodic external assessments, necessary corrective actions based on audit findings, good inventory management, well trained staff, and appropriate supervision are few key factors that maintain and enhance quality over time.\n\nUltimately, these accreditations should be viewed as \"minimum standards,\" and patients and healthcare providers alike should always consider other factors such as professional recommendations,"}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,How eating habits or certain foods impact sleep? How much should men be stretching at 25, 30, 35, 40, 45? Does the need to be flexible vary by age?", "output": "Eating habits can significantly impact sleep. A balanced diet promotes good sleep while certain foods can disrupt it. High-sugar diets may make a person more alert and less likely to fall asleep easily, while too much caffeine will similarly keep you awake. Alcohol, although initially sedative, disturbs the second half of your sleep-cycle causing frequent wake-ups and non-restful sleep. Foods that are rich in magnesium, such as nuts and seeds, and tryptophan, found in dairy products, can help promote better sleep.\n\nAs for stretching and its frequency, it largely depends on your physical goals and overall health rather than age. However, maintaining flexibility becomes important as we age because our muscles naturally lose strength and size leading to issues with balance and susceptibility to injuries. Everyone, regardless of their age group, should aim to do some form of flexibility exercises like stretching or yoga every day. The American College of Sports Medicine recommends adults to stretch major muscle groups at least two times per week.\n\nMen in their 20s and 30s generally have good muscular flexibility but sedentary lifestyles can lead to stiffness. Regular stretching helps prevent this. As men get into their 40's and beyond, muscle mass starts to reduce which could also affect flexibility. So taking time to maintain a good stretching routine is important during these years. Remember to always warm-up before stretching to avoid injuries, hold stretches for 15-60 seconds, and don't bounce or use jerky movements. \n\nFinally, note that"}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,My baby is 10 months old, and he is two months premature. If I feed him with solid food, he does vomiting. Is it not safe for him to feed with solid food?", "output": "Your baby is just 10 months old and was born two months premature, so his development (including feeding skills) may be a little different when compared to full-term babies. It's generally recommended to start introducing solid foods between 4-6 months of age for term infants, but in the case of your preterm infant, you should discuss with their pediatrician before introducing solids. His doctor will take into account adjusted age, not actual age.\n\nAlso, some babies initially reject or have difficulty accepting new textures or types of food, including solids, which can occasionally lead to gagging or possibly vomiting if they're not quite ready for it.\n\nHowever, regular vomiting after meals could be indicative of conditions like pneumonia, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), allergies, pyloric stenosis, etc. If your child consistently vomits after eating, I recommend bringing this up with their doctor who can evaluate your son and ensure there isn't a more serious underlying condition causing this symptom."}

I had taken a pregnancy test before I got my period because I was late and it was negative. I have mild PCOS. So, my periods are never on time but happens every month. Is it possible to be pregnant after you get your period?", "output": "Given your symptoms and the timing, it's more likely that what you're experiencing is related to ovulation rather than pregnancy. Around the time of ovulation, some women experience discomfort in the lower abdomen (ovulation pain or \"mittelschmerz\"), breast tenderness, increased sexual desire, bloating, and changes in cervical mucus \u2013 typically a clear, \"egg-white\" like consistency, which signals fertility.\n\nAs for your question about being pregnant after having a menstrual period, if the bleeding you experienced was a normal menstrual period, then it's unlikely that you would be pregnant from sex that occurred before that period. However, there can sometimes be confusion between an actual menstrual period and implantation bleeding (which can occur when a fertilized egg implants in the uterus), the latter usually is lighter and shorter than a typical period.\n\nStill, since you have PCOS and infrequent periods, I would suggest taking another pregnancy test if you continue to experience early pregnancy symptoms (nausea, vomiting, fatigue) or if your next period is delayed. It is also important that you consider seeing a healthcare provider and discussing appropriate contraceptive options.\n\nRemember: even though you might not be planning for a baby right now, if you still are sexually active without using contraception, there's always a chance you could become pregnant.

Zerodol is a medication that appears to have been providing some relief for you; however, it's mainly an analgesic and anti-inflammatory drug, not a specific treatment for migraines.\n\nMigraine management typically involves two types of medications: acute treatments (for attacks as they happen) and preventive medications, which aim to reduce the number and severity of your migraines. It sounds like you may benefit from considering some preventive options given your increased frequency of migraines. \n\nBeta blockers, antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs, CGRP inhibitors, and even Botox injections are among potential preventative measures used based on how frequent and severe the migraines are, and whether or not the patient has aura symptoms. Also note that many preventive medications take time \u2013 even up to several months \u2013 before they begin to work effectively. \n\nBefore any change to your treatment plan, I strongly recommend that you consult with a neurologist who can provide a comprehensive evaluation and discuss these possibilities. They may also want to investigate why the frequency of your migraines has increased suddenly. This could potentially involve imaging studies or other tests to rule out any underlying conditions. Lastly, always remember to mention any visual problems to your doctor, as this can be relevant in diagnosing and treating your condition."}

Oral Thrush: This is a yeast infection that develops inside the mouth. It appears as white patches that are often the consistency of cottage cheese. Oral thrush is known as candidiasis because it's caused by a group of yeasts called Candida.\n\n2. Leukoplakia: This condition causes cells in the mouth to grow excessively. That, in turn, leads to the formation of white patches inside the mouth, including on the tongue.\n\nAlthough both conditions aren't typically dangerous, they can lead to more serious problems if not addressed promptly. So, considering you don't have any risk factor like tobacco or alcohol use, it would nevertheless still be wise to see a healthcare provider just to rule out anything more serious. \n\nAnd remember, even though it might not seem like this could be related, overall health factors such as diet, hygiene, and stress can affect the health of your mouth.

It lasts a second or two but may repeat several times before stopping in five minutes or so. I went out in the garden today to dig a bit and wearing my HR monitor (I have got health anxiety, anxiety disorder as well as depression). As I was digging, the pain started hurting with each heartbeat. I looked at my monitor and it read 138 bpm. I am 70 years old and have been on medication (Benzodiazepines) for over 50 years for panic attacks and general anxiety. Two years ago I felt similar pain but not to this extent. I went to ER but nothing was found (the doctor said it could be costochondritis but definitely not my heart). I get bloodwork quarterly and everything was fine except cholesterol which was 235. I tried a statin but the muscle pain was too great. In my EKG I have RBBB or LAFB which 14 years back after a stress test I was told that I was probably born with it. I had gone to see the cardiologist then because of getting skipped beats and GERD he told me to ignore them. Last time I had an EKG was in the ER for six months when I had a weird pain in back and side. They checked out heart anyway and said it was fine. Probably just a colicky gallbladder. I have had stones for more than 20 years and had no surgery. So I hesitate to go to the ER again. My local doctor just closed. HR is still 88 while lying down right now. Usually, my resting heart rate is under 67.

It is inflammation of the cartilage that connects a rib to the breastbone (sternum) which often causes chest pain that can be mistaken for a heart condition like angina or a heart attack. Physical activity, such as heavy lifting or gardening may trigger or worsen it.\n\nHowever, I want to stress out the importance of seeking immediate medical attention whenever you experience new or unexplained chest pain. Despite previous episodes being attributed to costochondritis, the symptoms you describe can also be due to heart disease. Especially since you have raised cholesterol levels and a faster heart rate than normal (might be due your anxiety), these factors should not be dismissed lightly. Although your EKG has been fine in the past, sometimes underlying cardiac problems can go undetected between tests but show up later.\n\nFinally, don't forget about your gallbladder stones. If they move and cause a blockage it can potentially lead to symptoms such as severe right side or center abdominal pain, back pain, and increases in heart rate.\n\nTo conclude, although this could be costochondritis or related to your GERD (which can be aggravated by digging/gardening work especially if you bend over frequently - causing stomach acid to flow into your esophagus leading to pain/discomfort), I strongly advise you to seek medical attention to rule out any serious causes like coronary heart disease or gallbladder issues.

Please suggest me your valuable advice.", "output": "I understand your concerns and I'll do my best to provide you with an appropriate guidance.\n\nFirstly, a hypoplastic nasal bone is one of several markers that can increase the suspicion for Down's syndrome but it in itself does not confirm this diagnosis. Higher amounts of amniotic fluid (Polyhydramnios) can also be associated with fetal anomalies, but again isn\u2019t typically definitive for Down Syndrome.\n\nAn amniocentesis would help get clear information about chromosomal abnormalities, including Down's syndrome. The safety of this procedure has greatly increased over the years and under expert hands, the risk of complications such as miscarriage has been reported to be less than 1%. However, still there are minor risks which include harm to the baby or mother, infection, premature labour or leaking amniotic fluid.\n\nIn terms of termination, the laws vary depending on where you live: some countries permit termination beyond 24 weeks only if there's a substantial risk to woman's life or serious fetal anomaly. In others, termination at this stage may not be legal at all without these grounds. Therefore, you should consult with a local medical professional on this issue who's familiar with the laws in your area.\n\nAlternatively, you could consider non-invasive methods like cell-free DNA screening (cfDNA).

So, I need your help.", "output": "Your mother's MRI scan reveals some concerning findings. \n\n1. Small vessel white matter ischemic changes and a chronic lacunar infarct are signs of a lack of blood flow in certain areas of the brain, possibly due to small strokes. This could certainly be causing her dizziness. It often lurks without symptoms until it has caused significant damage, so it is imperative that she is treated properly to prevent more serious consequences like a major stroke.\n\n2. The findings of blooming in the GRE (a type of MRI sequence) suggest there might be deposits or lesions within these regions of the brain which may need further evaluation. While these might not be causing her immediate symptoms, it is important to seek specialist advice to ascertain their nature. \n\n3. As per mild cerebral atrophic changes, this typically refers to shrinkage or loss of brain volume, which tends to occur with aging. However, it can sometimes be related to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease. \n\nThe consultation with a neurologist would help guide further investigations into the cause of your mother's symptoms, including potential neurological issues. Vertigo and heavy-headedness, along with her radiological findings, definitely warrant a neurology follow up. You'll probably have to talk to your mother about the seriousness of the situation and gently persuade her to see a neurologist. Her fear is understandable, but untreated health problems can lead to far scarier outcomes than going to the doctor."}

I had a drop-by-drop bleeding the next morning after passing stool.", "output": "Hello, it's important to remember that while slight bleeding after any kind of sex might be alarming, it is not always due to a serious problem. Yet, medical concern should be definitely ruled out.\n\nIn your case, the most likely cause of bleeding after anal sex is an anal fissure. This is a small tear in the thin, moist tissue (mucosa) lining the anus, which can occur during rough or unprotected anal sex. Hemorrhoids could also cause such symptoms.\n\nHowever, other more serious causes like sexually transmitted infections (e.g., gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis) or trauma to the rectum/anus need to be ruled out. \n\nIt's essential for you to see a healthcare professional soon. They can properly evaluate your condition and offer treatment suggestions. Also, practicing safer sex, using lubricant as needed, and making sure all participants provide informed consent are fundamental ways to reduce injury and disease transmission."}

It could also be a condition like lactose intolerance or celiac disease, which would cause discomfort when she eats certain foods. The increased frequency of stools and stool accidents points towards an issue with digestion or absorption. \n\nHowever, because these symptoms can potentially indicate a range of issues from food sensitivity to more serious conditions, it's important to continue investigating this with her pediatrician. Keep track of any new symptoms or changes, what foods seem to increase her stomach pains if any, and the timing of her symptoms. Also, further tests that may need to include a blood test for Celiac disease, stool test for infections or malabsorption, and breath test for lactose intolerance.\n\nStool incontinence (or 'accidents') merits urgent medical attention, particularly because this is a new development and not normal for her - call her doctor today to discuss this latest symptom."}

Please help.", "output": "There could be several reasons behind your bleeding after intercourse, such as vaginal dryness, an infection, cervical or uterine polyps, or sexually transmitted infections. However, considering your history of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), it may have led to something called cervical ectropion (or \"cervical erosion\"). This happens when cells from inside the cervical canal, known as glandular cells (which are red and easily bleed), exist on the outside surface of the cervix.\n\nIn some cases, PCOS might also cause endometrial hyperplasia (abnormal thickening of the uterine lining) due to hormonal imbalances, leading to postcoital bleeding.\n\nHowever, it's essential not to diagnose yourself and seek medical help immediately. You should visit a gynecologist who would perhaps perform a pelvic exam, Pap smear, or other tests if needed, to diagnose the condition accurately. It would also be worth discussing your pain, even though you describe it as ignorable, it can carry important information.\n  \nKeep in mind that this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific causes may not apply to your situation.

And what is his life expectancy after 13 years of diagnosis of HF?", "output": "Given the history presented, your uncle appears to have stage D or advanced heart failure, which is characterized by significant structural heart disease and symptoms of heart failure at rest despite optimal medical treatment. The fact that your uncle has symptoms like shortness of breath, swelling in the abdomen and feet, wheezing, and coughing even after medications indicates severe dysfunction.\n\nHowever, regarding life expectancy, prognosis can vary greatly from patient to patient based on their health status, comorbidity, severity of symptoms, response to medication, lifestyle, etc. On average, about half of people who develop heart failure live beyond five years after diagnosis. Then again, considering his age, multiple heart events and surgeries affect his prognosis negatively.\n\nPlease consider discussing this in detail with a cardiologist or palliative care physician, since he seems to be experiencing advanced symptoms.

Doctor did not ask me anything about that red bump in my mustache area at that time. I have been suffering from mild fever as well after my lymph inflammation. Right now I am worried again since the red bump on my mustache becomes large, and from two or three openings drains watery liquid when I tried to squeeze it. It is really painful and irritates a lot. I am worried about HSV 1 since it is near my mouth. I am having mild fever and lymph infection. I am not in sexual contact for the last seven years. What is your suggestion? What might cause this problem?", "output": "The symptoms you describe sound like they could be due to a folliculitis or a furuncle (boil). This is an infection of the hair follicle that can occur after shaving, especially if the skin was not properly cleaned before the shave or the razors used were not clean. \n\nThe fact that the bump drains pus and has multiple openings suggests this might be a carbuncle, which is an agglomeration of several interconnected boils. The prescribed antibiotics should help in treating this.\n\nHowever, other conditions such as Herpes Simplex Type 1(HSV-1), impetigo, or even cellulitis could present similar symptoms. Also considering your ongoing lymph inflammation and mild fever, it's essential to get checked by a doctor for accurate diagnosis and treatment. \n\nPlease do not squeeze or try to drain the boil yourself; this could spread the infection.\n\nA digital physical examination will likely suffice, but your doctor may want to take a culture of the drained fluid if the antibiotic treatment doesn't lead to improvement.\n\nAlthough Herpes infections are often sexually transmitted, HSV-1 can also be contracted through nonsexual contact, so we cannot completely rule it out based on your sexual history alone.\n\nBut remember, nothing replaces direct medical evaluation. You should immediately consult with a healthcare professional.\n"}

Although we did have anal at times and I cannot be 100 % sure that the condom was there. I have also had a parasitic infection which affects my scalp for a couple of years. Is it possible for something to mimic HIV in tests? I have been to the dentist thrice in all my life for an extraction and checkups. I also had an appendicectomy 13 years back. I have had occasional IV therapy and a few injections. I have never shown any symptoms. I am also anemic.", "output": "I'm sorry to hear about your diagnosis but it's a good step that you have tested and now know your status. HIV is primarily transmitted through unprotected sexual intercourse, sharing of contaminated needles or other sharp instruments, transfusion of contaminated blood and from an infected mother to her child during birth or breastfeeding. The probability of infection can increase in presence of other sexually transmitted infections. \n\nIn your case, unprotected anal sex carries a high risk for HIV transmission even if performed only occasionally. As you mentioned you are not 100% sure that condom was always used during these occasions, this could be one possible route of contraction. Moreover, sometimes condoms can break without the users noticing it leading to exposure.\n\nHealthcare-associated transmission (like dental procedures or surgeries or injections) is very rare with today\u2019s infection control recommendations, enforced by virtually all healthcare settings. \n\nFalse positives may occur due to technical errors or cross-reactivity with other conditions on preliminary tests like ELISA, but confirmation tests like Western blot or PCR tests rarely give false positive results. Parasitic infections usually do not mimic HIV in tests, neither does anemia.\n\nThe lack of symptoms doesn't exclude an HIV infection since many people go years without any signs of disease.

However, I have been extremely anxious about this foot drop, and a couple of weeks ago I started to twitch, first in the legs and then all over my body, I can see the twitches. When I am talking with someone and thinking about something else, the twitches go away and come back when I think about it. I do feel weak in my body, especially in the legs. Can it be due to the anxiety? I am going to a neurologist, but there is a three months waiting period, and I am scared. I do not think we have had any ALS in my family. Please help me ease my mind.", "output": "From the symptoms you've shared, your concerns are of course understandable. Foot drop could be caused by several underlying conditions such as nerve injury, disorders of the brain or spinal cord, or muscle disorders. The twitching and feelings of weakness may indeed be related to anxiety, but without a thorough examination and possibly some tests, it is challenging to give an exact diagnosis.\n\nThe good news is that improvement in strength and function in your foot suggests that whatever might have initially caused the problem is either resolved or improving. As for ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis), this tends to present with a gradual worsening of symptoms rather than an improvement. It also often starts from one region and then spreads to other areas, so the fact that you're regaining some amount of normal control can be seen as a positive sign.\n\nWhile waiting to see your neurologist, try to manage stress and anxiety as best as possible to lower their potential influence on your physical symptoms. Practice mindfulness techniques, relaxation methods like deep breathing exercises, and get plenty of sleep. Low impact exercise within comfort limits may help the healing process.\n\nRemember, this advice doesn't replace seeing a doctor who can assess you personally and carry out any necessary investigations. You should consult a healthcare professional immediately if you note persistent or new neurological problems or if existing symptoms worsen."}

The doctors have also performed basic finger strength tests (spread fingers and resist ) and they say they are normal. Reflexes are normal. No tripping, dropping, slurring, etc. Should I be worried about this given the above scenario and that doctors have told me no atrophy and no weakness? Thank you.", "output": "Based on your description, it is not likely that you have ALS. In ALS, early symptoms include more constant and noticeable muscle weakness, loss of motor control in hands and arms, difficulty speaking, swallowing, or breathing, chronic muscle fatigue, uncontrolled outbursts of laughing or crying (known as emotional lability), and evident atrophy of muscles.\n\nMuscle twitches are quite common and often harmless, usually caused by stress, caffeine intake, or physical exercise. They can also occur randomly without having a serious underlying condition. Since you've already had personal examinations by multiple doctors who found no atrophy or significant weakness, you should try rest easy. Their findings suggest that this twitching doesn't seem to be part of a broader pattern indicating a severe neurodegenerative disorder like ALS.\n\nHowever, if these symptoms change, become worse, or if new symptoms appear, I advise you to consult your healthcare provider again for another assessment based solely on these changes. It wouldn't be necessary to jump to conclusions about rare, extreme conditions when simpler explanations are much more likely.

I do not have diminished lung capacity or problem in breathing, no wheezing, out of breath when I run but, I am overweight and out of shape. What do you think?", "output": "As a digital AI, I can't diagnose you but based on your description, it seems possible that several issues might be going on here. Chronic cough can indeed come from both acid reflux (GERD) and asthma, which sometimes coexist in the same patient. COPD typically occurs in people who have smoked at least 20 years; though you have quit smoking for 19 years, it's possible to develop COPD many years after quitting.\n\nHowever, given that you don't describe typical symptoms of COPD like constant shortness of breath or wheezing, it is less likely, although not impossible. Asthma would also usually present with some sort of wheezing or difficulty breathing which it seems you do not experience. Acid reflux could well cause a chronic cough without other specific symptoms.\n\nWeight loss and getting fit can potentially help reduce symptoms related to both GERD and asthma/COPD. However, I recommend reaching out to your health care provider as they can offer more personalized advice based on thorough medical examination and tests. They may also want to try treatment regimens for each possible diagnosis to see which one works best for you or refer you to a specialist for further evaluation."}

The sticky lube that came from his penis may actually be pre-ejaculate or \"pre-cum.\" It's a fluid which can carry sperm. However, it usually carries less sperm than actual ejaculate and thus the likelihood of pregnancy from this is significantly reduced.\n\nFor such scenarios where direct semen-to-vagina contact did not occur, the chance of conception is much lower compared to regular unprotected penetrative sex. Nevertheless, it would still be wise to monitor for any signs of pregnancy (missed period, breast tenderness, increased urination, etc.) if you are worried.\n\nIn order to better protect yourself from unintended pregnancies, consider using some form of contraception every time you engage in sexual activity, there are many options available including condoms, birth control pills, IUDs, hormonal patches/rings, etc. You should also remember that only condoms can help prevent sexually transmitted infections. \n\nThe best thing to do now is stay calm, monitor any possible symptoms and consult with a healthcare provider.

This exposure can lead to increased sensitivity and pain because the inner part of your tooth, which is normally protected, is now in direct contact with everything you eat or drink. Also, bacteria from your mouth can cause an infection inside the tooth.\n\nA root canal treatment is typically recommended if the pulp (nerve tissue) inside your tooth has been damaged by decay or injury. Symptoms indicating root canal treatment might be necessary include severe tooth pain, prolonged sensitivity to heat or cold, discoloration or darkening of the tooth, swelling and tenderness in surrounding gums.\n\nYour dentist would have suggested a root canal likely based on these factors:\n\n1. Depth of decay.\n2. Presence of symptoms such as pain or sensitivity\n3. Radiographic evidence (which may reveal spread of infection or damage to surrounding structures)\n\nLastly, after a root canal procedure, additional restorative steps are commonly required to prevent further damage, and this often includes a dental crown to provide stability to the compromised tooth.\n\nUltimately, if you're unsure about the recommendation for a root canal treatment and a crown, don't hesitate to seek a second opinion from another dentist for peace of mind."}

Certain types of breast cancer grow more quickly in response to these hormones, so blocking them can slow down or even stop the growth of those cancer cells.\n\nIt is important to have an open conversation with your mother's oncologist about your concerns. It is true that these treatments might make your mother feel unwell, but they are designed to eradicate any remnant cancer cells left within the body after surgery to prevent recurrence.\n\nHowever, alternative therapeutic approaches like targeted therapies or immunotherapies could be considered based on her cancer subtype and molecular genetics of the tumor, their eligibility would need discussion with her oncologist.

{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,If both the testes experience a reduction in blood supply (and thus oxygen and hormones), in the long run will it increase the risk of more spontaneous mutation present in sperms as lesser blood supply will affect the DNA replication and repairing ability of spermatogonial cells?", "output": "Yes, that's theoretically possible. Testes absolutely require a constant blood supply to function optimally. In fact, testicular tissue is highly sensitive to hypoxia (low oxygen level). Hypoxia can lead to less efficiency in tissue repair and cell reproduction which involve complex DNA processes. These factors could contribute to an increase risk of mutations in the germ cells that produce sperm.\n\nHowever, research directly linking decreased blood flow to the testes and higher spontaneous mutation rates in sperm has not been definitively established, and more studies are needed in this area.

However, I can provide you with some general insights.\n\nArcuate and bicornuate are types of uterine anomalies that may increase risk for miscarriage or preterm birth. Uterine shape is often associated with recurrent pregnancy loss, although the reasons aren't entirely known. Both arcuate and bicornuate uterus are structural abnormalities where a woman's uterus has an unusual form.\n\nAn arcuate uterus has a slight dip or indentation at the top (it\u2019s sometimes described as a \"heart-shaped\" uterus). A bicornuate uterus, on the other hand, is more of a severe malformation where the uterus appears to be heart-shaped but it has two distinct cavities, potentially making it harder to carry a pregnancy to term.\n\nWith both these conditions there are surgical interventions possible that might improve pregnancy outcomes. In the case of a bicornuate uterus, a surgery called metroplasty can be done to try to unite the two halves of the uterus. This might decrease the likelihood of miscarriage in future pregnancies.\n\nYour doctors seems to have initiated a comprehensive approach towards establishing the cause for the repeated missed miscarriages. Genetic causes, blood clotting disorders and suboptimal hormonal milieu during menstrual cycles are common causes aside from uterine anomalies.\n\nOnce the results for all these tests are back, each identified issue"}

I use almond oil and moisturizing soap, but it is not effective.", "output": "Dry skin can be a result of various factors including environmental, genetic, or underlying medical conditions. It seems like you have already been taking steps to manage this by using almond oil and moisturizing soap.\n\nHere are more recommendations:\n\n1. Hydrate: Drink plenty of water. Keeping yourself hydrated from the inside out is very important.\n2. Humidify: Use a humidifier in your home. This can help by adding moisture to dry indoor air.\n3. Protect Your Skin: Be sure to use sunscreen when going outside and protective clothing, especially during times of high sun intensity. \n4. Choose Skincare Products Carefully: Some skincare products can worsen dry skin. Avoid deodorant soaps and skin care products that contain alcohol, fragrance, retinoids or alpha hydroxy acid (AHA).  \n5. Bathing: Limit yourself to one 5- to 10-minute bath or shower daily. And use warm rather than hot water. After bathing pat your skin lightly with a towel leaving it slightly damp. Apply moisturizer within a few minutes of bathing to trap moisture in your skin. A thick ointment or cream could be more effective than a lotion.\n6. Wear Gloves: If you're doing dishes, laundry or cleaning around the house, wear rubber gloves to avoid chemicals from drying your skin.\n\nIf after implementing these suggestions there's no improvement, then I would recommend seeing a dermatologist as there might be an underlying condition causing this problem.

I cannot see clearly through my right eye; even I recognize thing pretty hard. I want to know whether it can be corrected, so that both my eyes work together. I am confused as I am now 26 years old. Is the correction going to be difficult at this age? I am looking up for a second opinion from you. Thank you.", "output": "Hello there. Based on your description, it sounds like you might have strabismus or misalignment of the eyes. The difficulty to see clearly could be related to this condition itself as the brain is forced to choose between two different images from each eye causing suppression of one and consequently amblyopia - also known as lazy eye. A comprehensive evaluation by an ophthalmologist is needed to confirm this.\n\nTreatment options for strabismus include wearing prescription glasses, certain types of vision therapy and in some cases surgery might be recommended to realign the muscles that control eye movement. Your age should not majorly affect the success of correction. If amblyopia is present - where one eye hasn't developed normal sight during early childhood - this can sometimes be harder to treat in adults compared to children, but it should still be manageable with the right care.\n\nNow, it's important to keep expectations realistic; while the treatments aim to promote better alignment of eyes and possibly improve visual acuity, full 'normal' functioning isn't always possible. Whatever treatment is chosen, regular follow-ups with your ophthalmologist will provide the best chance at managing this successfully."}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hi doctor,I am a 42 year old woman. Can I still conceive? Also, can I conceive twins without any risks?", "output": "Yes, a 42-year-old woman can still conceive naturally but it\u2019s important to remember that fertility declines as we age. After the age of 35, this process speeds up and by the age of 40, a woman's chances of getting pregnant each month are less than 5 percent. Therefore, for women over 40, it may take longer to become pregnant or they may need fertility assistance.\n\nAs for conceiving twins, while there is no guaranteed method to create twins naturally, certain factors increase the possibility: family history of twinning, certain fertility drugs or treatments etc., however, these methods also come with risks. Prenatal care should be more extensive and it comes with higher rates of complications such as gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, preterm birth, among others.\n\nIf you are considering trying to conceive at age 42, I would recommend discussing your plans with your gynecologist or a fertility specialist. They can provide guidance tailored to your health status and help assess any potential risks."}

So, I would like to take DHEA supplements for beard growth, is it fine?", "output": "Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is a hormone produced by your adrenal glands, and it can be converted into other hormones like testosterone and estrogen in the body. However, it's important to note that taking DHEA supplements won't assuredly increase facial hair growth because this largely depends on your genetics.\n\nFurthermore, there isn't comprehensive and definitive scientific research supporting the efficacy of DHEA for stimulating beard growth. Also, these supplements can potentially have side effects such as acne, high blood pressure, liver problems, hair loss and changes in cholesterol levels etc., which might outweigh potential benefits.\n\nFinally, to manage your prediabetic condition, it'll be paramount to focus more on maintaining a balanced diet, engaging in regular physical activity, losing weight if you are overweight, and managing stress effectively.\n\nExtended use of any supplement should be discussed with a healthcare provider. Therefore, I would recommend discussing with your doctor or an endocrinologist before starting any new medication or supplement regimen."}

Typically, the bleeding begins 1-4 hours after taking the second medication (misoprostol). If you've only taken the first medication (mifepristone), it may not induce bleeding since its main purpose is to block progesterone which is required for pregnancy. The bleeding associated with medical abortion normally starts once the misoprostol has been taken.\n\nIf you've taken both pills according to your provider's instructions and have not experienced any bleeding, you should get in touch with your healthcare provider immediately to address this situation. There could be a few reasons why you've not started bleeding, including the possibility of an ectopic pregnancy or the medication not working as intended.

I asked them to do a regular check and they said my heartbeat at that moment was 98 and he said this was fine.

She has been checking online for some answers and it is said stuff like arrhythmia, tachycardia, etc. She also says that the normal is between 80-100 bpm and why is mine on the top end? Is it a serious cause? Or does heart and pulse rate vary? Also, I have been checking the prevalence of heart diseases, etc., online and it is very rare for someone at my age. What more should be done?", "output": "It seems like you have done a thorough job investigating your relatively fast heart rate with your health professionals. In general, normal resting heart rate for adults ranges from 60 to 100 beats per minute (bpm). Your reading of 98 bpm is just within this range and may possibly be due to stress, caffeine or other factors not directly related to a disease condition.\n\nHowever, much also depends upon the individual's overall health. Some people normally have a heart rate faster than others. Athletes, for instance, often have lower resting heart rates, while those who are less physically active or have more fat tissue might experience slightly higher resting heart rates.\n\nStress or anxiety, dehydration, anemia, hyperthyroidism, fever, excessive consumption of caffeinated beverages or alcohol, certain medications, and recreational drugs can also prompt a faster-than-normal heartbeat.\n\nThe negative tests and positive feedback you've received from your healthcare providers suggest that there is no immediate cause for concern. However, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly, getting a good sleep and avoiding stress should help maintain your cardiovascular health.\n\nStill, if the conditions persist or get worse over time, or if you experience other alarming symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness or fainting spells, you should seek immediate medical attention. \n\nYour girlfriend's concerns appear to be rooted in her care and worry for you.

Please help.", "output": "If you're otherwise healthy, one testicle alone can potentially provide enough testosterone and sperm for fertility. Unilateral cryptorchidism (having only one testicle) generally does not interfere with a man's ability to have sexual intercourse or make sperm, both of which are functions related to hormones and overall health rather than the physical number of testicles. Not having an additional testicle won't impact your ability to get erections or achieve orgasm.\n\nRegarding your first-time experience, it is common to feel nervous and encounter difficulties. It may take practice and time for sex to feel comfortable. Make sure there is adequate foreplay to ensure that your partner is ready before penetration. Using water-based lubricants can also help. The anxiety can make things harder, try to relax and communicate openly with your partner about what each other wants and needs.\n\nIf problems persist, including erectile dysfunction or premature ejaculation, then I would recommend reaching out to a healthcare provider or a sex therapist.

Please advice.", "output": "Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder that affects the large intestine. While the exact cause of IBS isn't known, several factors may play a role:\n\n1. Intestinal muscle contractions: The walls of your intestines are lined with layers of muscle that contract as they move food along. If these contraction are stronger and last longer than normal, it can lead to gas, bloating and diarrhea.\n\n2. Abnormalities in the nerves of your digestive system: Problems in the nerves controlling sensation or muscle contractions in your bowel could cause you discomfort when your stomach simply inflates from gas or stool.\n\n3. Poorly coordinated signals between the brain and the intestines can also cause your body to overreact to the changes that normally occur in the digestive process. This overreaction can lead to symptoms like pain, diarrhea, or constipation.\n\n4. Infections: A severe bout of diarrhea triggered by a virus or bacteria can lead to IBS.\n\n5. Changes in gut flora: These are the 'good' bacteria in our gut, and changes here have been linked to IBS.\n\n6. Family history of IBS, sometimes families might have a similar working gut that could contribute to getting IBS.\n\nRegarding Management:\n\n1. Diet changes: Identifying triggers of IBS can help.

If so what medication should I take to avoid pregnancy? Also, if I take a blood test now, will it be more accurate?", "output": "Based on the symptoms you described and considering your urine test, it seems likely that you may be pregnant. A pregnancy test usually indicates a pregnancy if there's a strong pink line along with a faint one.\n\nHowever, a faint line could sometimes mean a very early stage of pregnancy or perhaps an evaporated line which can sometimes appear if an at-home pregnancy test is read after the instructed time. They can also occur due to certain other reasons including low hCG levels which could be because of miscalculating how far along you are, chemical pregnancies, unspecified fertility issues etc.\n\nIn any case, I would highly recommend you consult your doctor/gynecologist for a blood test as it's more accurate than a home pregnancy urine test. The blood test can detect pregnancy hormones about 6-8 days post ovulation whereas over-the-counter urine tests need at least 14 days after fertilization (generally waiting until you miss your period increases their accuracy).\n\nAs for your query about medication to avoid pregnancy, since you may already be pregnant, it's important to seek professional advice rather than try to self-administer any kind of medication. Termination of pregnancy has legal and medical implications; it varies widely depending on where you live and options should be discussed thoroughly with healthcare professionals. \n\nPlease see a healthcare provider promptly to discuss your situation and obtain appropriate care."}

Some women require a higher dosage during pregnancy. \n\nRegular testing of your thyroid function (every four to six weeks) throughout pregnancy will also allow any necessary adjustments in your medication with regards to the growing needs of baby.\n\nFolic acid supplements you are taking are very beneficial during preconception and early pregnancy to prevent neural tube defects in babies. Recommended dosage usually ranges between 400-800 mcg per day.\n\nHowever, this general advice does not substitute a routine check-up or visiting your endocrinologist for optimal personalized care."}

Please suggest something.", "output": "Hair loss can occur due to various reasons including genetic predisposition, hormonal changes, stress, poor nutrition, certain medical conditions or medications, and aging. It's important to identify the underlying cause in order to effectively manage hair loss. Here are some general tips that might help:\n\n1. Nutrition: Eating a balanced diet is crucial for hair health. Include enough protein (found in lean meats, fish, eggs), vitamins (especially A, C, D, E), iron (green leafy vegetables) and omega fatty acids (nuts, seeds, fish) in your diet.\n\n2. Healthy scalp care: Regularly massage your scalp with oils like coconut, almond, olive oil to generate blood flow which can stimulate hair growth. Use a gentle shampoo and conditioner, avoid harsh chemicals.\n\n3. Avoid heat treatments and tight hairstyles: Excessive use of hair styling tools like straighteners, curlers, blow dryers etc. can lead to hair damage. Also, wearing tight hairstyles can result in traction alopecia, a type of hair loss.\n\n4. Medications: Rogaine (minoxidil) is an over-the-counter medication approved for treating male and female pattern baldness. Propecia (finasteride) is another prescription medicine used in men. However, these should be taken only under a healthcare provider's supervision.\n\n5. Procedures: Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) therapy, hair transplantation are some of the more intensive methods of managing hair loss that a dermatologist may offer you"}

This has been an ongoing issue for a year and it has started to affect my life. I have tried everything. Antibiotics, hydration, douche, apple cider vinegar, AZO pills, yeast infection drugs, UTI drugs.", "output": "Your symptoms of dark and foul-smelling urine could be due to several reasons. You mentioned that you have had STD screens and kidney function tests, which presumably were normal or else you would need specific treatment for any abnormal results.\n\nA possible cause could be dehydration so it's important to drink plenty of fluids. If you already hydrate well, other potential causes include liver disease, certain metabolic disorders such as phenylketonuria or maple syrup urine disease (very uncommon), or urinary tract infections (UTIs). \n\nSince you've undergone various kinds of treatments including antibiotics without any improvement to your symptoms, it might be time to reconsider the diagnosis. It is also important to note that douching is generally not recommended as it can disrupt the natural bacterial environment in the vagina and can potentially lead to other problems like infections. \n\nYou should see a urologist or nephrologist who may want to evaluate your bladder and kidneys via imaging studies or cystoscopy (a look inside the bladder with a small camera). The doctor will take a detailed history from you about associated symptoms as well: Do you have any abdominal pain? What colour is the urine? How regular are you going to urinate? Any issues with your diet?\n\nVisit your healthcare provider promptly to rule out any potentially serious conditions. Please don't begin or stop any medications or supplements without talking to a professional. Always consult your personal physician or other qualified health provider with any questions about your medical condition."}

I am depressed abt the fact that left tube is absent but four follicles ruptured on the same side. Please give me some hope of getting pregnant. The endometrium lining is 9 mm which the doctor said is very good. And, this is my first IUI after lap.", "output": "I understand that this is a stressful time for you. Having a unicornate uterus with a single functioning ovary and fallopian tube can make conception more challenging, but it doesn't make it impossible. The good news is your endometrium lining of 9mm indicates a healthy and receptive environment for an embryo to implant, which is a very positive sign for pregnancy.\n\nRegarding the follicles rupturing on the left side: if you have a functioning ovary on the left and a uterine horn on the same side (even if rudimentary), there is still a chance that you can conceive from that side. However, the specific chances would depend on various factors such as the exact anatomy of your uterus and tubes, your age, general health, sperm quality etc.\n\nWith IUI, the fact that you've had healthy follicles that have ruptured and released their eggs is encouraging, because during IUI procedure, the sperm is introduced directly into your uterus and not into your tubes, so egg and sperm do not need to meet within the fallopian tubes as in natural conception. \n\nHowever, because you've mentioned about your right ovarian cyst and laparoscopy, it's important to feed back any discomfort or unusual symptoms to your treating doctor or fertility specialist. They can give you the best advice personalized to your unique situation based on all the medical details they hold.\n\nThe journey to pregnancy can sometimes be long and arduous, and having obstacles might cause frustration and sadness."}

Tell me some things to cure this.", "output": "A clicking sound in the knee without any pain is generally not considered a sign of serious disease, especially at your young age. It's fairly common and can often be due to the ligaments or tendons sliding over the joint surfaces, or due to harmless bubbles popping within the synovial fluid that lubricates your joints.\n\nHowever, if you notice other symptoms such as swelling, stiffness, instability, locking or reduced range of motion, it would be advised to consult with an orthopedist. This could indicate conditions like arthritis, meniscus tears, or patellofemoral syndrome, though these are less likely in your demographic.\n\nAs for management:\n\n1. Strengthening Exercises: Start doing exercises which strengthen your quadriceps (the muscle group in front of your thigh). Add hamstring (the muscle located at back of your thigh) strengthening exercises too. Both muscles provide support for the knee joint.\n2. Maintain a Healthy Weight: If your weight is higher than what is healthy for your height, losing weight will reduce stress on all your joints, including your knees.\n3. Wear Supportive Shoes: Appropriate footwear contributes to overall alignment and may influence knee health.\n4. Warm-Up Before Exercise: Always take time to warm up before starting your workout routine. Gentle stretching can help prepare your joints for activity. \n\nRemember, if there is any change in your condition, please seek advice from a healthcare professional."}

Continual draining and antibiotics may not completely eliminate the disease if the sac of the cyst is still present under the skin.\n\nHowever, since you currently prefer non-surgical options, here's what we can do:\n\n1. Continue local care: Keep the area clean and maintain regular dressing changes. This will help limit further infections and promote healing.\n\n2. Antibiotics: If there's ongoing drainage and inflammation even after completing the antibiotic's course, you might need another round or a different medication, based on sensitivity patterns of the exuded pus (if culture and sensitivity tests were done).\n\n3. Topical Treatment: Some studies suggest certain medical-grade honey dressings or other topical treatments can aid wound healing. \n\nBut remember, these approaches will just manage your current situation, and likely won't prevent future cyst flair-ups as effectively as surgical removal. So should there be no improvements or if it worsens weeks or months from now, I highly recommend getting in touch with a surgeon to discuss options relevant to your individual case. Also, please coordinate with your healthcare provider for any decision you make regarding your treatment."}

The specialist had a quick feel and then told me it was normal, that I should not worry and that I would have to get used to it. He also implied it has been happening since the operation and I just did not notice.There is still no pain, only discomfort (it varies) normally when I walk. I think that my right testicle is a tiny bit swollen and slightly squishier than my left and while I could live with this, I really do not want to.

I am 88 kilos and have lost 12 kg over the last nine months. I have have been running more frequently for about eight weeks. I am 24 years old.", "output": "Your change in physical activity (running more frequently) with weight loss could very well relate to the discomfort you're feeling, as high-impact activities often cause 'jostling' of the testicles and this is pronounced with individuals having had prior surgery or issues. The sensation of a loose stitch may indicate that one of the sutures used during your operation has worked its way toward the surface, which is not uncommon.\n\nHowever, noticeable swelling on one side should be investigated. Epididymitis, inflammation of the tube at the back of the testicle, can sometimes account for changes in size/consistency, although it's usually associated with pain. \n\nWhile your specialist\u2019s advice cannot be dismissed, if you are uncomfortable with his conclusion, please consider getting a second opinion. Using an ultrasound will provide definitive imagery about the state of the testicle, stitches, blood supply etc., making it much easier to diagnose and treat any potential problem. It's also important to ensure self-exam regularly and report any changes promptly. If the discomfort persists or get worse, make sure to consult another urologist soon.\n"}

Can you advise if I should be concerned about serotonin syndrome if I take the 25 (or 50) mg of Trazodone? Additionally, should I be concerned about anything else in terms of taking these three medications together?", "output": "Serotonin syndrome can occur when you increase the dose of certain types of medications, or add a new drug to your current regimen. Symptoms usually occur within several hours of taking the new medication and can range from mild (shivering and diarrhea) to severe (muscle rigidity, fever and seizures).\n\nIn rare cases serotonin syndrome has been reported when SSRIs/SNRIs (like Paroxetine and Fluoxetine) are taken in combination with Trazodone. The risk might be higher with higher doses. Therefore it is important that if Trazodone is added as an adjunct treatment then it should be started at a lower dose initially.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that while the risk does exist, overall it's quite low, and most people do not develop serotonin syndrome when combining these medicines under medical supervision.\n\nThe primary purpose of Trazodone is antidepressant but because of its sedative effects, it is also used by some individuals for insomnia.\n\nAtivan which is a benzodiazepine can sometimes cause dependence or tolerance over time, meaning you may feel like you need to gradually increase your dose to get the same effect. It's meant for short term use and ideally shouldn't be relied upon long term.\n\nOverall these medications have different mechanisms of action and can potentially interact so it is important that your doctor closely monitors you whilst you're on them.

Pelvic floor exercises: These can help improve control over your pelvic region and reduce painful sensitivity.\n\n2. Use of lubricants: Dryness is another factor that can contribute to pain during intercourse. High-quality water or silicone-based lubricants may help.\n\n3. Gradual Desensitization: This often includes vaginal dilators that come in a range of sizes.

It aims to stimulate collagen and heal the skin which may reduce stretch marks over time.\n\nRemember, all these methods may not fully remove stretch marks but can make them less noticeable. Also, response to treatment vary from person to person. Please consider seeing a dermatologist who can recommend a personalized approach based on your specific condition and medical history. \n\nMost importantly, know that having stretch marks is normal, particularly after puberty, pregnancy, or weight changes. It does not impact your health and should never lead to personal distress or discomfort. If this is affecting"}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,My mother was not having her periods from the past five years, but from yesterday, she started bleeding again. In these five years, she has not even bled for a single day. Why is she bleeding all of a sudden? What can be the cause?", "output": "Your mother's sudden bleeding needs immediate medical evaluation. Considering your mother hasn't had her periods for five years, it seems like she is likely postmenopausal. Postmenopausal bleeding can be a sign of several conditions, some of which are serious. \n\nThe most common causes include polyps (benign growths) from the cervix or uterus, endometrial atrophy (thinning of the uterine lining), and endometrial hyperplasia (thickening of the uterine lining). The latter two are due to hormonal imbalances.\n\nIn rarer cases, it can also be associated with more serious conditions such as pelvic organ prolapse or postmenopausal cancers like cervical cancer or endometrial cancer. While many of these causes aren't necessarily severe or dangerous, others require prompt treatment. Therefore, this isn't something to ignore - I advise you to arrange a Gynecological examination for her promptly."}

The chest pain could be related to your ulcer, especially if it's a gastric (stomach) ulcer which can sometimes cause pain or discomfort in the mid-chest area. An inactive status of hepatitis B doesn't mean it cannot flare up and cause symptoms, but these are typically fatigue, joint pains, loss of appetite rather than chest pain. However, chest pain should always be taken seriously because it can also be an indication of heart conditions, lung conditions, and other serious illness. It would be best for you to seek immediate medical attention to rule out any life-threatening conditions such as a heart disease. They may conduct further tests such as EKGs, blood test, endoscopy, X-rays, etc. to evaluate your condition more thoroughly. Please don't delay getting this checked."}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,I got bitten by what I am thinking a spider a week back. I figured since it seemed to have a little white and liquid coming out. So, I squeezed it. It has been four days and the bite is painful. Now I have a white circle where it once was just red and oozing. I have tried Cortisone but I do not see it getting better.", "output": "Based on your description, it sounds like you may have an infection or an abscess from the spider bite that needs treatment. Squeezing a spider bite can force bacteria deeper into the skin, leading to infections such as cellulitis (a common bacterial skin infection). The white circle could potentially be pus under the skin, which is another sign of an infection.\n\nIt's also important to mention that certain spiders (like brown recluse and black widow) are poisonous and their bites can cause severe reactions. \n\nTopical cortisone often does not help much with infections. You should immediately contact a healthcare professional for evaluation. Depending on severity, you might need antibiotics or even minor surgery to drain the infected area. It's advisable not repeat squeezing a spider bite again in future.\n\nIn addition, look out for systemic symptoms like fever, chills, or increasing pain--these would be reasons to seek urgent medical help. Please remember this is not a substitute for qualified medical advice and you should seek care promptly."}

Also, on my right side near my breast with a slight headache as well. What it could be?", "output": "I'm an AI, but based on your symptoms, this could be representative of several conditions. The pain shooting down from your neck to your fingers could possibly represent a pinched nerve in your neck (cervical radiculopathy) or another nerve-related condition. This kind of pain can also suggest issues with your peripheral nervous system. \n\nAs for the pain near your breast area, it could be related to a number of things, ranging from muscular issues to potential problems with organs or tissues in that area. \n\nThe slight headache could be associated with tension or stress, or even potentially tied to the same neurological issue causing your neck and arm pain.\n\nPlease be reminded that these are only possible explanations. It's crucial you get evaluated by a healthcare provider as soon as possible who can take a thorough history, perform physical examination, and decide if any diagnostic tests are needed to confirm the cause of your discomfort and guide treatment. Delaying medical attention especially if symptoms persist or worsen may lead to complications."}

The next morning my belly button is out half an inch. My surgeon said just wait for a couple of days to see if it goes back down. I need to know if I should wait or get in right away. The belly button is a little tender.", "output": "As an AI doctor, I can tell you that this could potentially be a small recurrence of your hernia or post-surgical swelling but it could also be purely cosmetic due to changes in the umbilical contour after the surgery. If it is tender and starts to cause considerable pain, or you notice other symptoms like fever, nausea, vomiting, or if the bulge does not reduce on lying down, then these could be signs of complications and you should seek immediate medical attention.\n\nThe usual practice would be to follow your surgeon's advice as they are most familiar with your case. If you're uncomfortable with waiting, there is no harm seeking a second opinion right away just to remain safe."}

Please request your advice on how to stop this frequent motion and reason for this happening and is this normal? He also makes a noise like sounding from inside especially more during night time, having trouble while breathing due to a chest cold, so am giving Rinoclear saline drops three to six hours once depending on his nose block. Please advise why baby makes such noise, is it normal?I was feeding breast milk via bottle for four to five days when he was two weeks old since he was unable to suck through mother\\s nipple. I stopped bottle when I encountered this frequent motion and with my doctor\\s advice.", "output": "Based on your baby's symptoms, it sounds like he could be having lactose overload or overactive letdown. This is quite common in exclusively breastfed babies and may cause them to have frequent bowel movements due to insufficient digestion of the lactose in the milk. The curdy yellowish color stools are a typical sign of exclusive breastfeeding and generally normal unless there is mucus or blood present.\n\nRegarding his skin condition around the anus, it could be from the frequent wetness from stooling so often. It\u2019s important to keep the area clean after each bowel movement and use an appropriate barrier cream to protect against irritation.\n\nThe sounds your infant is making might be related to his nasal congestion which you're treating with saline drops. Clearing his nasal passages will help him breathe easier. However, if you ever notice any signs of difficulty breathing, such as quickening breaths, flaring nostrils or cyanosis (bluish lips), seek immediate medical attention.\n\nAs you mentioned that you had issues with breastfeeding initially, in addition to addressing your baby's frequency of stools, I recommend reaching out to a lactation consultant who can address any concerns about feeding techniques, positioning, and overall breastfeeding management.\n\nHowever, given the recurring issues it would be best to consult with your pediatrician just to ensure all is fine. They would be able to more directly examine your baby and make accurate evaluations."}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,If I get my wisdom teeth extracted, do my second molars shift in that empty spot?", "output": "After wisdom teeth extraction, there is no specific tendency for your second molars to shift into the empty spot by themselves. However, it's not uncommon to observe some sort of minor tooth movement after extraction,which might result in minor alterations in bite and alignment. Usually a gap left by an extracted tooth can potentially cause surrounding teeth to move to fill in the space over time, which can impact the overall balance of your bite.\n\nThe chance of such shifting is less likely as you age due to increased rigidity in the periodontal ligament fibers. Consulting with your dentist or oral surgeon is crucial since each patient's case is unique and they can go on to provide more accurate individualized advice post-removal care."}

So, I find happiness in everything. What I find difficult is to commit to her in some way as I see she may get a better person who will be supportive to her achievement. I do not underestimate myself, but there is a dilemma which is hurting me in my mind. Please advice.", "output": "As a doctor, I would like to say that mental health is just as important as physical health. The feelings you describe could lead to anxiety or worsened depression if they're not handled properly, so it's essential to address them.\n\nFirstly, understand that everyone has their strengths and weaknesses. It sounds like you admire her for her achievements but remember that she may also admire you for qualities you have which she may not possess necessarily. \n\nAbout commitment, being supportive isn't only about matching someone\u2019s achievements, it's more about emotional availability, understanding, respect, love, and being there in good times and bad. Nobody is perfect, we all are humans with flaws. But we can always strive to become better versions of ourselves.\n\nYou are not alone in feeling like this, many people experience similar sentiments when considering commitment. It's important to open up honest and respectful communication about your insecurities with each other. This doesn\u2019t mean that one person is better than the other, or deserves more or less. It might help both of you understand each other's perspectives, expectations, and bond better.\n\nAlso, if you find yourself struggling with these thoughts frequently, consider seeking professional mental health support such as a psychologist or psychiatrist who can provide guidance tailored specifically to your situation. Finally, if your feelings of depression escalate or return, again reach out to a healthcare professional who can help you manage them effectively."}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,I suspect I may have tapeworms. How can I be sure and what can I do to get rid of them?", "output": "Hello, tapeworm infection can sometimes be hard to diagnose as the symptoms may vary and are often mild. However, some symptoms may include abdominal pain, diarrhea, fatigue, loss of appetite or weight loss. In more severe cases, it might cause changes in behavior or seizures. \n\nTo confirm if you have a tapeworm, your doctor can order tests like a blood test or stool specimen analysis. The organism could show up under microscopic examination of your stool.\n\nIf testing confirms a tapeworm infection, anti-parasitic medication is usually the next course of treatment. These medicines are designed to paralyze the tapeworm, causing it to release its hold on your intestines. It will then be expelled from your body with a bowel movement. \n\nHowever, keep in mind that while these drugs eliminate adult tapeworms, they aren't always effective against tapeworm eggs or larvae. That's why prevention - ensuring proper food and water safety practices - is an important part of addressing tapeworm infections.\n\nThis advice is purely informational and does not replace a visit to your healthcare provider. Please consult with them to address your concerns fully.\n"}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hi doctor,My periods started 14 days before and I had sex eight days back. Should I take pills after unsafe sex? If yes, what is the procedure to take I-pill?", "output": "Emergency contraception (like the I-pill) is most effective when taken as soon as possible after unprotected sex but still has some effect for up to three days afterwards. Unfortunately, eight days have passed since your risky sexual encounter which exceeds the recommended time frame for using most emergency contraceptives.\n\nHowever, you should consult with a healthcare professional who can guide you appropriately based on your specific circumstances and needs. For instance, there are other forms of emergency contraception such as the Copper IUD that can be inserted up to five days after unprotected sex.\n\nIf you take an I-pill or another form of \"morning after\" pill in the future, you must follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully. Generally, these types of pills should be taken as one single dose as soon as possible after unprotected sex.\n\nIn addition, remember that emergency contraception is not meant to replace regular contraceptive methods and does not protect against sexually transmitted infections. Regularly using another method of contraception (like birth control pills, IUDs, condoms, etc.) is the best way to prevent unwanted pregnancies. It's also important to get tested for STIs if you've had unsafe sex."}

Further, currently it is on my lips and additional sores are there inside the upper part of my mouth. There is no pain. Please advise so that this can be permanently cured.I am currently taking Acivir 800.", "output": "Based on your description, it sounds like you're experiencing recurrent episodes of herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV1) infection. This is the most common cause of cold sores around and inside the mouth. Unfortunately, this is a viral infection, meaning there's not currently a way to completely eliminate the virus from your body. However, there are treatments available to control outbreaks.\n\nYou're already using Acivir 800 (Acyclovir), which is an antiviral medication used in treating infections caused by HSV. It can help speeding up healing of sores and decrease symptoms when used as directed by the physician during an outbreak. \n\nTo prevent frequent recurrences, maintain good oral hygiene practices such as regularly brushing and flossing your teeth. Avoid stress as much as possible because it can also trigger cold sores. Limit sun exposure to your lips, eating a balanced diet, getting enough sleep, and keeping yourself well hydrated may help reduce outbreaks.\n\nMy advice would be to continue the use of the prescribed medicine but also consult your doctor about suppressive therapy. This means taking antiviral medication daily to prevent outbreaks. This strategy might be helpful if you have frequent cold sore episodes. \n\nPhotographs obviously make diagnosis more clear. To provide pictures, typically you would upload them through the patient portal of the clinic or hospital you attend.\n\nLastly, remember that HSV1 can be contagious even without visible symptoms, so avoid sharing objects that come into contact with your mouth during active infection periods, especially"}

I had a history of pulmonary tuberculosis two years back and I took a six months medication and I am done with it. I just want to ask if fibrosis can be cured if I take medication and do exercise daily and eat healthy foods?", "output": "Fibrosis refers to scar tissue that develops in the lung as a result of damage, such as from an infection like tuberculosis (TB). Once fibrosis has formed, it's generally permanent. It does not typically reverse even with medications or lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise. However, progression of fibrosis can often be halted or at least slowed down, particularly when the underlying cause, in this case tuberculosis, has been treated and is under control.\n\nMaintenance of good health through balanced nutrition, regular exercise, avoiding smoke and other respiratory irritants, staying up-to-date with vaccinations, and managing chronic conditions can all help your overall lung health and limit any additional lung damage.\n\nIn some severe cases, oxygen therapy or a lung transplant might be options, but these are usually last-resort treatments for serious lung diseases.\n\nYou should discuss with your doctor about the severity of your condition and what specific actions you should take.

My TSH is under control, and it is 2.63 now.", "output": "Triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) are thyroid hormones, which play key roles in our bodies' metabolism. The pituitary gland, located at the base of the brain, controls their production by releasing Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH).\n\nThe normal range for Total T3 levels can vary depending on the laboratory but generally it will fall within a range of 80-200 ng/dL. With your value of 208.57 ng/dL, your level is slightly elevated.\n\nHowever, interpreting these values needs to be done along with symptoms, clinical conditions (like pregnancy), and other thyroid tests like Free T4, Free T3, and TSH. Each lab has a different reference range based on the population they serve and the techniques they use and it is best to interpret the results with reference to those ranges.\n\nIn pregnancy, hormonal changes can cause slight fluctuation in the thyroid hormone levels, but if you do not have any symptoms suggestive of hyperthyroidism (e.g., palpitations, weight loss, anxiety, tremors), this slight variation might not be clinical meaningful.\n\nYour TSH levels are normal and healthy.

While forceful vomiting may lead to petechial hemorrhages in some cases, bruising under the eyes is not often seen in this situation. \n\nHis bruised eyelids might be related to trauma (e.g., hitting or rubbing his eye), a bleeding disorder, or as a side effect of certain medications like blood thinners. Since the symptom appears serious and abnormal, it would be best if your friend consults with a healthcare provider as soon as possible to identify what's truly going on.

Now after 10 months has passed I found out that I have two warts inside my vagina. It is white color although, the one on the top started to have a slight pink color. But the second one on the bottom which is much smaller still has completely white color and around the vagina blades, I have a little while dots. Also, there are very tiny warts line along the blades. So, when I went to see the GP near my house he had a look and said that there is nothing to worry it is still small. But in my opinion, I think it is quite big. So the doctor gave me a prescription for Condyline paint which he told me to use for three days only per week and I have to keep using it for three weeks and if it does not get better he told me to see him again. Now I have a few questions. Is this mean I have an HPV virus inside my body? How can I make the virus go away permanently? Will Gardasil injection make it go away? If it does not go away permanently, how can I make sure that I have no HPV viruses and so these warts will not come back again? Is this mean that I have this HPV from my boyfriend? How to use Condyline paint correctly? I wash my vagina blades and use the cotton pads to dry it, then I use start to use the Condyline paint. I only dip the swab once into the reagent and then I open my vagina blades so that I am able to paint the two warts inside my vagina as much as I can. Then I paint it all over the very tiny warts in the vagina blades area. Am I doing it correctly?Now I have been using the Condyline for two days, but the very tiny warts that are around the vagina blades started to grow more. Is this mean anything? Can condoms prevent these HPV viruses? If I break up with my boyfriend, will this help my symptoms and health to become better? I am very scared of whether this can leads to cancer? I do not want this to ever happen to me again, how can I prevent this to happen again?If my warts are gone can I have sex with my boyfriend? Will these symptoms comeback again?

HPV is a viral infection: There currently is no cure for the actual virus itself, but there are treatments available for the symptoms (like the genital warts).\n\n2. Condyline Paint could help reduce/eliminate the warts, but you should follow your doctor\u2019s instructions on usage carefully. If you were prescribed to use it only three times a week for three weeks, then you need to stick to that regimen.\n\n3. It's good if you use cotton pads to dry the area before applying Condyline paint as it can cause significant pain and irritation if applied on wet or damp skin. However, you may want to double-check with your healthcare provider regarding painting all over the very tiny warts area method, and also about increasing wart sizes after starting the treatment.\n\n4. The Gardasil vaccine will not treat an existing HPV infection or its symptoms. Its purpose is preventive \u2014 it stops certain strains of HPV from infecting your body in the future. \n\n5. Regarding HPV transmission, yes, these types of viruses are usually transmitted through sexual contact. That doesn't necessarily mean your boyfriend gave it to you, but it's possible.

However, I still want to help out with some general advice.\n\nSevere phimosis often causes difficulty in retracting the penile foreskin and may require treatment. Treatments could include steroid creams, preputioplasty (a surgical procedure that widens the foreskin), or circumcision, a more definitive measure for severe cases that don't respond to conservative treatments. \n\nRegarding the bluish veins you mentioned, it's quite normal to have visible veins on the penis, they might appear blue or purple in color depending on skin tone and blood oxygen levels. Sometimes these veins become more prominent under certain conditions such as heightened sexual arousal or if there is increased pressure forcing the veins to enlarge. Certain vascular conditions can cause this like varicocele or thrombophlebitis; however, these are usually less common. \n\nThe pain sensation on touching the penis tip could be related to the phimosis or could indicate an infection, inflammation, or trauma at that site which needs medical attention.  \n\nMarijuana use doesn't directly contribute towards phimosis but remember, smoking can lead to systemic circulatory issues that over time can affect overall health including genital health.\n\nAlways consult a urologist as planned!

I am told that beta-blockers even though anti-arrhythmic can also be pro arithmetic as well should I take this every day or should I only take this when I start to feel palpitations.", "output": "Based on your description, it sounds like you suffer from frequent heart palpitations that are causing significant discomfort (rated 8/10). It's reassuring that your ECG, echo and Holter monitor tests have come back normal - suggesting no structural or rhythm abnormalities in your heart. Nevertheless, the symptoms you describe can indeed be perplexing and distressing.\n\nPropranolol is a beta-blocker medication often used to treat conditions such as high blood pressure, angina, certain types of arrhythmia, and it is also used to reduce anxiety-driven symptoms. It appears Propranolol has been effective at calming your symptoms based on your description.\n\nTo address your question regarding whether you should take this daily or only when experiencing symptoms, I would recommend discussing this further with your cardiologist. They are familiar with your full medical history and can provide the most appropriate recommendation tailored for you. \n\nWhile it is true that in rare cases, beta blockers can induce an arrhythmia, these incidents are usually in people who already have specific existing heart conditions. Since your cardiac tests were reported normal, it would seem your risk is likely low, but again, discuss these concerns with your doctor.\n\nAlso, symptoms not responding to normal treatment protocols might benefit from being reviewed by a specialist center with expert Doctors if possible. If palpitations continue despite negative test results, further tests including psychiatric evaluation may be warranted to rule out anxiety-related disorders that may present similarly. As always, please communicate any new symptoms or changes"}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hi doctor,I am a 49-year-old woman and last month I was hospitalized with a necrotizing soft tissue infection on my thigh. I had two debridement surgeries and was discharged after 5 days. I was treated with about 4 IV antibiotics. I do not remember them all, I recall seeing Vancomycin and Penicillin. I was told that the infection was not MRSA, but a \"slower moving bacteria\" they did not tell me what it was. I was swabbed for MRSA in my nose and butt before both surgeries and was told I did not have it. For the last day of my stay, I had a roommate who had a bad MRSA infection on her butt and sometimes had diarrhea incontinence during dressing changes. I had no physical contact with her, but we had the same nurse. I was discharged with a five day course of Augmentin.The wound has been healing very well and has not gotten infected, but three weeks after discharge I got an abscess under my arm. I went to an urgent care and was prescribed Clindamycin and told to return in three days for drainage. The abscess did not improve or get worse over the three days. I got it drained and was prescribed Augmentin and told to also continue the clindamycin. That was a week ago and the wound is healing well. They called today and said cultures show it was MRSA and they prescribed Bactrim and told me to stop the other antibiotics.I am feeling devastated by this and wanting to understand why it happened. Could I have gotten it in the hospital? I am concerned that it will not go away. Are those swabs at the hospital conclusive and mean for sure I did not have MRSA a month ago? I have never had any medical problems before and these experiences have been very frightening. Is there anything else I can do to prevent recurrence? I have read about everything from bleach baths and hibiclens to antibiotics in the nose.", "output": "I understand your concerns, and it's certainly a distressing situation. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a bacterium that causes infections in different parts of the body and is tougher to treat than most strains of staphylococcus aureus because it's resistant to many commonly used antibiotics.\n\nIt's possible you acquired MRSA from the hospital, as hospitals are common places where these bacteria can be found; this is known as hospital-acquired or nosocomial infection. However, we cannot definitely discern how or where you got the bacteria. Health care providers always take extra measures to prevent MRSA spread including strict hand hygiene protocols.\n\nIn terms of your swabs at the hospital, they were likely accurate at that time, but doesn't necessarily mean you couldn't have been infected with MRSA afterwards.\n\nThe good news is the Bactrim you've been prescribed is proven effective for treating MRSA. To help prevent future recurrences:\n\n1. Practice good hygiene: Wash your hands often with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.\n2. Keep wounds covered: Bandages can help protect others from MRSA, and help you avoid spreading it to different parts of your own body.\n3. Don't share personal items: Items like towels, razors, clothing, and athletic equipment can be a source of MRSA transmission.\n4. Regularly clean frequently touched surfaces.\n5.

The first one was 40 minutes; I could not recall the whole of that period. I came back with an injured knee and felt dazed. I was fine after around two hours. The next day, I felt pressure in my head and as though I was about to die. I then could not recall getting home or the rest of the night. I was fine in the morning. Two days later, I felt horrendous pain in my head, felt like I was swimming, then tried to go home and again could not recall from deciding to go home to around two hours later and I was foggy for the rest of the night. I have had constant pain in the left side of my head above the temple for four years. It does not go. However, In the past two weeks, I have felt like it is throbbing and at times about to burst out. I was meant to see my neurologist three months back, but his receptionist did not follow the recommendation, and now I am unsure whether to have the tests done. I feel like we are playing with my life. Usually, I am pretty relaxed about the possibilities and know it is a migraine. But this feels different. This feels like intense throbbing above my ear from the temple along towards the back of my head, with a pain in my ear to just behind my jaw under my ear. My instinct says that an aneurysm needs ruling out. I do not know if I am just upset because it feels so different and this pressure is intense. It is a weird feeling.

The symptoms you've described, particularly the unfamiliar and intense pressure in your head along with periods of lost memory are quite concerning. While it could be an extension or severe form of hemiplegic migraine, conditions such as transient ischemic attacks (mini-strokes), seizures, or indeed aneurysms should also be ruled out. Given the intensity and persistent nature of your symptoms, it is best not to wait for four months until the next scheduled appointment. \n\nHere's what I recommend:\n\n- You should seek immediate medical attention at an urgent care or local ER, given the severity, recurrence, and change in your symptoms.\n- Explain all of these symptoms to the attending physician including any changes in the characteristics of the pain and any other accompanying symptoms.\n- Try to ensure that a CT scan or MRI of your brain gets done urgently as these can pick up signs of an aneurysm or stroke.\n\nAs for the breathlessness and inability to climb stairs without stopping, this could potentially be related to a cardiac condition, pulmonary issue or even an aftereffect of severe migraines which can occasionally cause nonspecific systemic symptoms. However, these need to be properly evaluated with relevant tests. Don't hesitate to increase the urgency considering the wide range of significant symptoms you're experiencing. It is absolutely your right to do so if you feel something is not right with your health. \n\nRemember always: when it comes to one's health, it is"}

My wife is very much unsatisfied. How to cure this issue?", "output": "Premature ejaculation (PE) is a complex medical issue that can be caused by various factors, both physical and psychological. Therefore, managing it can often involve several steps:\n\n1. Behavioral techniques: Some techniques like the 'start-stop' method or the \u2018squeeze\u2019 method may help you to delay ejaculation.\n\n2. Topical anesthetics: Anesthetic creams and sprays that contain a numbing agent, such as lidocaine, numb the penis to delay ejaculation.\n\n3. Counseling: Speak with a mental health professional about your experiences. Factors such as stress, depression, and anxiety can lead to premature ejaculation.\n\n4. Medicinal therapy: Certain medications such as antidepressants (like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors - SSRIs) might help delay ejaculation.\n\n5. Pelvic Floor Exercises: Strengthening pelvic muscles using certain exercises could help you gain better control over your ejaculatory reflexes.\n\nIt's important that you see a healthcare provider in person for an examination and consultation. They could carry out necessary tests and then give advice suited to your personal needs for managing premature ejaculation.\n\nIn severe cases, take advantage of combined treatment plans. This could mean taking medication whilst attending sexual counseling. Additionally, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, such as exercising regularly, getting enough sleep, and having a balanced diet, can have positive effects on sexual health.\n\nRemember that there's wide variability in what is considered normal ejaculatory latency, and satisfaction levels differ from couple to couple.

I just want to know about its long term consequences as I am afraid of breast and ovarian cancer.", "output": "If you have Polycystic Ovarian Disease (PCOD), it's important to know that this condition can indeed affect your fertility. Women with PCOD often have an imbalance in their reproductive hormones, which can prevent the ovaries from releasing eggs regularly. However, many women with PCOD are still able to conceive with the help of certain treatments.\n\nRegarding egg donation, there is a need for hormone stimulation to increase the number of mature eggs in one cycle. These hormones can possibly stimulate cysts already existing because of PCOD, and leads to Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) which could be a potential complication.\n\nAs far as links between egg donation and breast or ovarian cancer, most research done so far does not suggest any increased risk. Nevertheless, we must note that long-term studies on egg donors are limited and it is always best to consult with a healthcare professional regarding these concerns.\n\nHowever, since you mentioned a family history of breast cancer, you should discuss this with a genetic counselor or cancer specialist too. Some families carry gene mutations that increase risk for both breast and ovarian cancers.\n\nAlso consider long consultation with your gynaecologist about the process of egg donation, its benefits, risks and how it may impact your PCOD as well as future implications on overall reproduction.

Do I need to take blood thinner medicine?", "output": "I'm an AI and can't look at lab results or perform physical exams. Still, I'll attempt to provide some general advice based on the symptoms you shared.\n\nFeeling weak, tired, dizzy, and experiencing frequent headaches might indicate several conditions, ranging from less serious situations like dehydration or nutrient deficiencies to more severe ones like hormonal imbalances, infections, neurological disorders, etc. Increased bowel movements also hint towards a possible issue with digestion or absorption of nutrients.\n\nAbnormally high levels of hemoglobin or hematocrit could suggest Polycythemia Vera (a kind of blood cancer), though it's just one potential cause amongst others. Not all such cases point to a stroke, heart attack, or even polycythemia - these are more complex conditions requiring comprehensive diagnostic inputs.\n\nHigh hemoglobin, per se doesn't grant immunity to feeling weak or tiredness; instead, other factors like less efficient oxygenation, low iron levels or nutritional deficiencies may still produce such feelings. Whether or not you need a blood thinner depends on various factors which only your doctor, after detailed examination, could conclusively decide.\n\nIt's very important that you consult a healthcare professional promptly for appropriate tests, diagnosis and treatment considering your symptoms persisting for three weeks now.

Currently, I have a mild skin eczema. I also had seborrheic dermatitis in my scalp a few years ago. But it is under control with special shampoo treatment. I had one fingernail with a similar problem but it was in a milder condition. I thought it was nail fungal. I used Mometasone furoate 0.1 % cream for my skin eczema. It cleared up when my nails grew. I have an allergy to pollen.", "output": "From your description, it seems like you may be dealing with a condition called onycholysis. This is the painless separation of the nail from the nail bed, often resulting in a white or yellowish discoloration. Many factors can cause this condition including trauma (too much pressure on the nails), fungal infections, reactions to chemicals/products used on the nails or underlying conditions like psoriasis.\n\nGiven that you have a history of eczema and seborrheic dermatitis, skin issues could be contributing to your nail condition. Furthermore, ridges are normal for many people while others may find them as a sign of aging. \n\nKeeping the nails short and avoiding nail polish or artificial nails can be helpful. You should avoid picking at the nails or using them as tools to prevent further damage. Protecting your hands by wearing gloves when doing chores or anything that will expose your hands to water and harsh chemicals can also help. \n\nHowever, I would strongly suggest that you visit a dermatologist who can perform appropriate tests to rule out possible causes such as nail fungus or psoriasis and guide you through specific treatments based upon the root cause of your onycholysis.\n"}

However, I can tell you generally about endobronchial nodules. This type of nodule could be due to a variety of factors. It could be related to an infection or inflammation; however, in someone with a smoking history, there is definitely an increased risk of lung cancer. The size (0.2 cm) is quite small which may be reassuring, but an appropriate evaluation usually involves comparing this scan to prior scans (if available) to look for growth or changes, as well as potentially additional types of imaging or procedures. In some cases, physicians might adopt a 'wait and see' approach with regular monitoring scanning to assess if the nodule grows over time - a characteristic of cancers. Remember, please consult your own physician as soon as possible to address your concerns directly."}

Please help.", "output": "It's completely understandable to be concerned about your health. It's true that CT scans do emit radiation, and high levels of radiation exposure can increase the risk of cancer over time. However, it's important to remember that the relative risks are generally quite small compared to the benefits gained from accurate diagnosis and treatment. \n\nThe amount of radiation you get from a single CT scan varies depending on the exact type of test you're having, but two chest, abdomen and pelvis scans would typically equate to an approximate additional lifetime risk of future cancer of less than 1 in 1000. \n\nHowever, this estimate is based on the assumption that probability of developing cancer because of radiation exposure is proportional to the dose received, there's ongoing debate if such lower levels of radiation exposure significantly increase your risk.\n\nAlso, one must consider the reality that if doctors were investigating potential lymphoma, the information obtained from those CT scans was crucial. In other words, the benefit of being able to diagnose and potentially treat any serious condition far outweighs the relatively small increased risk of cancer due to radiation. \n\nRemember that medicine is all about balancing potential risks with clear benefits, and diagnostic imaging like CT scans allow physicians to see what's happening inside body noninvasively, which makes them invaluable tools for modern medicine. \n\nMaintain follow-up with your regular doctor, live a health-conscious lifestyle, and make sure to always share any concerns you have regarding treatments or testing.

By the way, I did my acne scar regions with 2.00 mm needles.", "output": "Alcohol can dehydrate the body and skin which could potentially delay your healing process, as good hydration is important for skin repair. Normally, it's ideal to avoid alcohol consumption for about 48-72 hours after a dermapen session. However, everything depends on the individual reaction of the organism, so it may vary.\n\nIf you drank few bottles of beer after the procedure it doesn't necessarily mean that your healing time will be longer than six weeks. However, it might have compromised the results slightly or caused more inflammation or prolonged redness after the treatment.\n\nSince you had acne scar regions treated with 2mm needles, this does involve deeper penetration into the dermis and the recovery period may be slightly longer than with shallow treatments. With significant treatments like this, I'd suggest waiting at least one week before consuming any significant amounts of alcohol. While complete healing should be achieved in six weeks, maintaining healthy habits such as adequate water intake and minimum alcohol consumption would be beneficial for overall skin health. \n\nRemember to always follow your skincare professional's advice when it comes to aftercare following procedures like micro needling.\n"}

I am primarily looking for reassurance.", "output": "While I can't physically examine your wound, it's good to know you\u2019ve been in regular contact with health professionals who can. Frenuloplasty is a relatively minor procedure and complications are rare, but they can occur. Sutures coming apart or not holding the incision closed as expected is possible depending upon various factors like type of suture material used, tension on the wounds etc.\n\nYour doctor's advice to observe for two more weeks seems reasonable -- healing from this kind of procedure typically takes a few weeks and everyone heals at different rates. As long as there aren't any signs of infection (like increased redness, swelling, pus discharge, fever) or you're not having any substantial increase in pain, waiting and monitoring appears prudent.\n\nMeanwhile, continue to keep the area clean, avoid unnecessary manipulation, maintain a healthy diet to facilitate wound healing and minimize activities that could potentially disrupt the wound (like intense physical activity). If you notice new, concerning symptoms, reach out to your healthcare provider immediately.\n\nIn case if you have concerns about the cosmetic appearance after healing due to stitches coming apart, a urologist should be able to help assess this as well. The ultimate decision will depend both on how much functional or cosmetic issue this creates for you. \n\nRemember, digital advice cannot replace an in-person examination. It will always be best to follow up directly with your specialist who has examined you and knows your medical history."}

If your tooth is impacted, it's possible that the surrounding gum may be inflamed and infected. This can lead to pain just like what you are experiencing right now.\n\nHowever, since physical visits pose a risk due to COVID 19, there are a few things you can do at home for temporary relief:\n\n1. Rinse your mouth with warm salt water.\n2. Use over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or paracetamol (only if not allergic).\n3. Apply a cold pack on the area where you're feeling the discomfort.\n\n\nDespite these measures, I strongly recommend you arrange a telehealth appointment with your dentist or healthcare provider. They might help guide you regarding further management based on your symptoms. It's important not to ignore this, especially if the pain recurs or worsens. In some cases, surgical removal of the wisdom tooth might become necessary."}

Recently, I have been not feeling too well, and my hiatal hernia pain become moderate and doest really go away. I am currently on Rabeprazole and Motilium.", "output": "Protein shakes in themselves do not specifically cause harm to a hiatal hernia, unless they are causing symptoms like indigestion or acid reflux which partly can be due to high fat content. You should avoid heavy and fatty protein shakes if you notice such issues.\n\nYour recent discomfort may not necessarily be related to the protein shake but could just mean your hiatal hernia condition is getting worse. Stress, certain foods, alcohol, smoking, obesity, and even some medicines for other conditions can exacerbate the symptoms of hiatal hernia.\n\nThe medications you're on (Rabeprazole - a proton pump inhibitor that reduces stomach acid production; Motilium - for relief from nausea, vomiting, bloating) are appropriate to manage common symptoms linked to hiatal hernia.\n\nHowever, if there's an increase in the intensity of pain and it doesn't go away, I'd recommend seeking immediate medical attention. It\u2019s important to rule out complications like strangulation where the blood supply to herniated stomach gets cut off.\n  \nRemember to take small meals more frequently, avoid lying down or bending over soon after eating, maintain a healthy weight, avoid smoking and limit alcohol. These steps might help alleviate the symptoms. Also, consider speaking with a dietitian who understands gastrointestinal disorders to give accurate advice about your diet including protein shakes."}

Is this an infection or something else? I took an Unwanted 72 before three days.", "output": "It sounds like you may be dealing with an issue such as a vaginal infection or sexually transmitted disease (STD), possibly even something like cervical inflammation or polyps. These can cause pain during intercourse, bleeding after sex, and the associated discharge, irritation, and itching. However, this is just speculation based on the symptoms you provided. It's also important to note that Unwanted 72, an emergency contraceptive pill, shouldn't have these side effects.\n\nI strongly suggest you make an immediate appointment with your gynecologist or other healthcare provider for a full examination and possible STD testing. Only a healthcare professional can diagnose your specific issue properly. Please do not engage in sexual activity until you have seen a doctor and received treatment if necessary. Don't panic and remember that many infections are treatable.\n\nAdditionally, while Unwanted 72 is effective at preventing pregnancy, it does not protect against STDs.

I am on birth control but after doing the oral intercourse two days later I started my period that was a week early and lasted 14 days. Can I get pregnant?", "output": "Based on your question, if the oral intercourse you mentioned refers to oral sex - involving mouth and genitals - you cannot become pregnant from that activity, regardless of ejaculation or precum. Fertilization typically occurs in the female reproductive system when sperm comes into direct contact with an egg during vaginal intercourse.\n\nThe occurrence of pregnancy requires sperm to fertilize an egg inside the female reproductive system, specifically within the fallopian tubes after ovulation, and this cannot occur through oral intercourse. \n\nAs for your period coming a week early and lasting 14 days, there are several reasons why menstrual cycles might change, including stress and anxiety which you mentioned you've recently been experiencing. Changes could also be caused by changes in weight, certain medical conditions, etc. But birth control should help regulate your cycle.\n\nHowever, it's always best to reach out directly to your healthcare provider if you have questions about your birth control, cycle changes, or potential risk of pregnancy. Severe/lengthy bleeding can also be a symptom of other underlying health issues so discussing this with your healthcare provider would be recommended."}

Treatment for Elbow Pain Due to Computer Use: \n\n   - Rest: Taking breaks from your computer can provide some relief. Aim to take frequent short breaks rather than less frequent longer ones.\n   - Ergonomics: Make sure your workstation is set up properly. Your chair and desk should be at the right height, and your keyboard and mouse should be within easy reach.\n   - Physical Therapy: Exercises that strengthen the muscles in your arms can help reduce pain.

Heart problems related chest pain usually comes on with exercise (angina) and improves with rest. If your ECG and 2D echo are normal and there's no improvement or worsening of symptoms with physical activity, it's less likely to be heart-related.\n\nGERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease), which is a digestive disorder that affects the ring of muscle between your esophagus and your stomach can also cause chest pain. This type of chest pain tends to exacerbate after eating or at night, and can improve by taking antacids.\n\nThe fact that you're experiencing chest pain due to stress and it did not respond to Cita-S (SSRI used for reducing anxiety and depression) suggests another possible diagnosis, which could include musculoskeletal pain or even conditions like Costochondritis (inflammation of the cartilage in the rib cage).\n\nGiven your symptoms last more than one year, I'd suggest you consult with a gastroenterologist to consider GERD or other gastrointestinal causes,\nalso involving a psychiatrist considering a longer acting anti-anxiety medication or cognitive behavioral therapy might help if stress is the main issue causing these symptoms.\n\nRemember that online advice is never a substitute for professional medical advice from your local healthcare provider since they have access to your full history and clinical examination findings.\n"}

She tapered off the Lamotrigine, which was very difficult.It has been three to four weeks since her last dose of Lamotrigine, and nine weeks since her infusions. She is feeling very moody and depressed, irritability, fatigue, loss of focus. The question is, do you think she needs to go back on the Lamotrigine? Or does she need to get a booster shot of Ketamine? Both are difficult solutions. Getting off the Lamotrigine was awful, and getting Ketamine requires out of town travel, etc. Kindly advice.", "output": "It's important to remember that I am relying only on the information given and cannot make a direct medical diagnosis or recommend specific treatments. However, your wife's symptoms indicate the presence of lingering depressive symptoms, which could be due to her bipolar II disorder. It sounds like both Lamotrigine and ketamine have been beneficial for her in the past.\n\nEach option has its own set of considerations: restarting Lamotrigine can take weeks to months to reach full effectiveness again, and it may potentially produce similar side effects she experienced while tapering off. On the other hand, getting another round of ketamine infusions involves travel but might work faster to alleviate her symptoms.\n\nBefore making any decision, it is essential to discuss these options with her current psychiatrist who can evaluate her current condition, review her history, and weigh pros and cons based on exact details. It is also necessary to explore whether there are additional treatment modalities\u2014such as psychotherapy\u2014that could help manage her mood swings alongside medication. Sometimes a combination of approaches tends to work best for managing symptoms of bipolar disorder.\n\nPlease consult her mental health provider before making any changes to her medication regimen.

Also, having headaches.", "output": "It sounds like you might have a condition called dry socket, or alveolar osteitis. This happens when the blood clot that normally forms after an extraction is dislodged or dissolves. That leaves the bone and nerves exposed to everything in your mouth, resulting in pain and bad odor. It can also lead to an infection if not properly treated. \n\nThe headaches could be related to the inflammation or infection at the site or possibly from referred pain due to the issue with your tooth.\n\nI would recommend making an immediate appointment with your dentist or oral surgeon for evaluation. They will likely clean the area and may place a medicated gauze into the socket to help promote healing and reduce symptoms. Depending on the situation, they may prescribe antibiotics as well.\n\nIn the meantime, rinse your mouth gently with warm salt water every 2 hours and after eating to keep it clean. Also, avoid smoking, using straws, and anything else that might cause a suction motion in your mouth. Keep hydrated and eat soft foods. Analgesics such as ibuprofen (unless contraindicated) can help manage the pain. You should seek immediate professional attention to prevent potential complications.\n"}

He has a previous history of Bell\\s palsy, a little hearing loss, and was also diagnosed with a small lesion in the hypothalamus which is not cancerous. I want to know whether these traumatic events have played a part in these symptoms or its due to the lesion. The MRI of the brain shows the possibility of glioma. Please suggest.", "output": "I'm sorry to hear about your father's situation. It seems like he is dealing with quite a lot right now. From the symptoms described, it appears your father may be suffering from a severe condition known as Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), or clinical depression, which could have been triggered by the traumatic loss he encountered.\n\nAdditionally, his short-term memory loss, disorientation, and confusion between dreams and reality might suggest potential neurological issues beyond depression. Given that he has a history of Bell's Palsy, has had vascular changes in the brain due to aging and has a small lesion in the hypothalamus, these might contribute to the symptoms. \n\nThe possibility of glioma shown in the MRI scan could also manifest similar symptoms of cognitive impairment, including problems with memory. This will certainly need further investigation.\n\nIn summary, while the recent traumatic events likely play a role, all other factors mentioned should be considered too. I'd strongly recommend you to consult with a psychiatrist for his depressive symptoms and a neurologist for further evaluation regarding the possible glioma and existing brain lesion. It's crucial to manage both his mental and physical health at this point. The earlier the intervention, the better chances there are for improvement and preservation of his functionality and quality of life."}

If I feed baby will that pus affect my baby?", "output": "I'm sorry to hear that you've been experiencing discomfort and anxiety after your I and D (Incision and Drainage) procedure for the breast abscess.\n\nIt appears that you might have experienced re-infection or perhaps an incomplete resolution of the initial infection, especially if you noticed thick pus. At this point, it is crucial to contact your doctor and/or gynecologist again as soon as possible. They will be able to evaluate your current condition accurately, potentially order diagnostic tests, and make a decision about additional treatments such as antibiotics.\n\nFeeding your baby in these conditions evokes valid concerns. If there is indeed an active infection with pus, it might pose a risk to your baby's health because infectious particles could possibly contaminate the milk. For now, until you can get further guidance from your healthcare provider, consider expressing and discarding milk which may feel painful due to blocked milk ducts and engorgement but is necessary to maintain milk production for when you're able to resume breastfeeding safely.\n\nThis advice is based on general medical practice; specific management might change depending upon clinical findings by your local healthcare provider."}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hi doctor,What is the difference between IntraLasik and Contoura Lasik?", "output": "IntraLASIK and Contoura LASIK are both types of laser eye surgery performed to correct vision, but they offer different technologies and procedures:\n\n1. IntraLASIK: This technique makes use of a femtosecond laser to create the corneal flap instead of a blade. The laser results in a precise flap that fits back perfectly during recovery. It's less likely to cause complications compared to a bladed procedure.\n\n2. Contoura Lasik: Also known as Topography-Guided LASIK, this is an advanced form of customizable LASIK that uses topographical mapping of your eye to guide treatment. This allows surgeons to perform highly individualized vision corrections based on the unique shape of your eye's surface. It has been shown to improve visual acuity beyond what regular glasses or contact lenses can provide.\n\nSo the main difference is how the surgeon prepares your eye for the treatment (i.e., how the corneal flap is created) and how the actual correction is carried out (standard corrections vs highly personalized ones). Both procedures serve similar purposes, i.e., to help patients get rid of eyeglasses or contact lenses and improve their eyesight significantly.\n\nIt's important to discuss these options with your doctor, considering factors like your overall health, eye condition, lifestyle, and personal preferences before deciding which option is best for you."}

I have been crazily searching to see if this is a result of any swollen lymph node fearing cancer but I could not find anything out of the ordinary on the body. Very rarely I feel this pressure going upwards to the ear and even more rarely a sudden pain arises inside the ear too but I hear no ringing or sounds. The weirdest thing is today I woke up with this sensation and I could feel heaviness behind my ears.This has come after an acute sinus infection, cough, night sweats (for which I had to take antibiotics) that hit me when I started tapering off Lyrica last month. I have had chronic sinus issues in the past too but this one was different, never had it progress to this level. I have uploaded an image of where exactly the pain or pressure originates but right now the pain or pressure is pretty spread out randomly across the neck.

Stopping Lyrica, having a sinus infection and dealing with chronic health conditions can all take a toll on your body. The symptoms you are describing could be due to many causes like TMJ disorders, infections, neck muscle stress or even Masotiditis.\n\nBut given your recent headcold/sinusitis and the location specifics of your pain, two things come to mind:\n\n1) It's possible that this could be related to your sinuses as they drain into the areas near your ears and neck which could create pressure and discomfort. The residual inflammation from your last bout of acute sinusitis might still be causing a certain degree of obstruction in your sinus outflow tracts leading to these congestive symptoms.\n \n2) You may also be feeling the effects of lymph node swelling (lymphadenopathy). If your lymph nodes are reacting to a past/present infection, it is more likely for them to cause pain and give a 'heavy' sensation rather than being linked to a cancer, especially if these symptoms appeared following an infectious episode.\n\nThe medicines you're taking (especially Loratadine D for allergies and ongoing Xynosine nasal spray use) support the notion of unresolved sinus issues.

Focus on non-weight bearing exercises for now.\n\nPhysical therapy is typically highly beneficial for this type of problem. Visiting a physical therapist can provide a tailored program of stretches and strengthening exercises that should offer relief and prevent future problems.\n\nOver-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications like ibuprofen near the affected area may help with initial pain management.\n\nMost importantly, it would be best to schedule an appointment with an orthopedic specialist who can confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential problems.

It sounds like you're experiencing some anxiety about this, which is quite common and normal.\n\nThe average penis size when erect can range from 4 inches to 6 inches approximately, with significant variability. This is all genetically dictated - you cannot make it larger or smaller by any form of exercise, including sexual activity or lack thereof.\n\nHowever, overall physical health can play a role in penis size. Being overweight can make the penis appear shorter as fat makes up around the base of the penis.

However, it is crucial to ensure you choose the appropriate type of laser treatment as there are several types.\n\nAblative lasers remove layers of skin around the scar tissue and encourage new, healthy skin to grow in its place. Non-ablative lasers stimulate collagen growth, which helps 'fill in' the scarring from within. Fractional lasers treat microscopic columns of skin at a time which allows for faster healing.\n\nApart from laser treatments, other options include Chemical peels, Dermabrasion/Microdermabrasion, Fillers, Microneedling (collagen induction therapy), or even surgery depending on the severity of your scars.\n\nPlease understand that every individual's skin is unique, so the course of action varies per person. It is advisable to consult with a dermatologist who will examine your skin type, the severity of your scarring, and discuss your desired outcome. They would then be able to suggest the best plan for you based on these findings. Remember not to rush this process as you want to find the most beneficial solution for you.\n\nAlso, while undergoing treatment, continue following a good skincare routine. Keep your face clean, use non-comedogenic products, and protect your skin from direct sunlight, as UV radiation can make scars more noticeable and slow down healing.\n\nRemember any procedure involves potential risks and benefits, so ensure you fully understand these before making a decision."}

{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,I had unprotected oral sex with a CSW. I ejaculated in her mouth. She ran quickly to spit. I do not know if she was HIV positive or not. Should I be worried about my health?", "output": "While the risk of HIV transmission through oral sex is generally lower compared to vaginal or anal sex, it's not zero. There are several factors that can increase this risk such as the presence of gum diseases, open sores in the mouth, or genital infections on your part. Given that you have had an unprotected sexual encounter with a commercial sex worker whose HIV status is unknown, I would advise you to get tested for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) as soon as possible for your peace of mind.\n\nIf you believe you may have been exposed to HIV within the past 72 hours, discuss with your healthcare provider about Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP), which involves taking antiretroviral medicines as soon as possible after potential exposure to reduce the chance of becoming HIV-positive. \n\nLastly, remember to use protection (condoms/dental dams) during any future sexual encounters. It's especially important for potentially risky situations such as relations with someone whose STI status you don't know."}

My social anxiety usually springs me into full-blown panic attacks like shaking, feeling unsteady, trouble catching breathes, extreme twitchiness and my throat close up. I wanted to go for an audition for a singing competition, but I have social anxiety, and it is a severe debilitating symptom. I have been wondering if there is any medicine to take as a temporary sedate as it is enough for me to perform, and to stop taking them when it is not needed.", "output": "I am really sorry to hear about your struggles with anxiety and depression. As a physician, it's important for me to tell you that while there are medications that can help manage these symptoms short term, they should not be used as a standalone treatment.\n\nBeta-adrenergic blockers such as Propranolol is often used 'as needed' to control physical symptoms of anxiety like shaking and twitchiness. It doesn't directly affect the emotional symptoms of anxiety but by reducing physical symptoms, it can help to feel more in control of the situation.\n\nIn addition to the potential use of medication, I strongly recommend seeking long-term therapy and support from a qualified healthcare professional or counselor. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been shown to be very effective in managing social anxiety disorder and could help to address the root cause of these symptoms, making situations like your audition easier to deal with in the future.\n\nAlways remember any medication must be prescribed and monitored by a healthcare professional due to potential side effects and interactions with other possible medications you're taking."}

The flaking is limited to the scalp, and my doctor has prescribed Folitrax 5 mg and Aprezo 30 mg. I am having this problem for about four to five years. I am able to control flaking in the scalp by washing with shampoo but, it reoccurs after a day with hair loss. Can it be controlled? Or can it spread to other parts of the body?", "output": "Sebopsoriasis is a complex skin condition that has features of both seborrheic dermatitis and psoriasis, which is characterized by flakes on the scalp and sometimes other parts of the body. It often flares up periodically then resolves, but can become more persistent.\n\nFolitrax (Methotrexate) and Aprezo (Apremilast) are medications commonly used to treat psoriasis. They help reduce inflammation in your body, thereby helping to control symptoms like flaking and redness.\n\nThe condition itself doesn't usually spread to uninvolved areas of the body. Instead, new spots may appear on different skin surfaces independent from places where it's already established. Also, the severity of the disease and its progression vary for each individual. Sometimes, lifestyle modifications such as minimizing alcohol intake, maintaining a balanced diet, reducing stress, avoiding harsh soaps/shampoos, and using emollients can assist with managing the condition. \n\nYour hair loss could be due to relentless inflammation, scratching or friction on your scalp. This should improve as you continue treatment, but if it does not, it would be worth mentioning this concern to your doctor.\n\nWashing your hair regularly with a medicated shampoo specifically designed to tackle sebopsoriasis can be beneficial. These types of shampoos contain ingredients like ketoconazole, zinc pyrithione, tar etc. which have anti-inflammatory and antifungal properties which will help control the scale and flake build"}

Please suggest what is this? And how I can clear this?", "output": "The condition you are describing could possibly be folliculitis, an inflammation of the hair follicles, or keratosis pilaris, a common skin condition that causes tiny bumps on the skin surface. These conditions can sometimes appear similar but have different treatments.\n\nIn case of folliculitis, it is often caused by bacterial infections, fungal infections, viruses, or even injury to your hair follicles. They usually resolve with time provided proper hygiene is maintained. Topical antibiotics are also used in some cases. \n\nKeratosis pilaris on the other hand has no cure as it's chronic and tends to flare up periodically. It can be managed with routines that involve regular moisturizing and exfoliation. Also, keeping the skin at warm instead of hot water when bathing helps.\n\nCreams like Clop-G (which contain steroids) might decrease the inflammation temporarily making them look smaller for a while, however these creams should not be stopped abruptly without consulting a doctor as they may cause unwanted side effects like thinning of skin, discoloration etc., if used for longer periods without supervision.\n\nI would suggest you to consult a dermatologist who can examine you properly, confirm the diagnosis and put you on suitable treatment regimen. If required, don't hesitate to ask for prescription alternatives for long term use which have minimal side effects.  \n\nRemember, never to self medicate with prescription drugs, always follow the instructions of a qualified healthcare provider."}

I am pleased for your advice.", "output": "If your nephew's nasal bone is indeed deviated inwards due to the fall, he may have a condition commonly known as a deviated septum. This condition may interfere with normal breathing and might lead to nosebleeds or frequent sinus infections.\n\nIf an otolaryngologist (ear-nose-throat specialist) has diagnosed this condition and the child is experiencing significant symptoms such as difficulty breathing or recurrent infections, surgery like a septoplasty may be considered. But typically, ENT doctors prefer to wait until a child's facial bones are fully developed before they consider surgical intervention unless there are serious breathing issues, frequent nosebleeds, or recurrent sinus infections. Understandably, these decisions are often made on a case-by-case basis by the consulting doctor who can assess all aspects of the patient's health status.\n\nIn any case, please continue seeking medical advice from a pediatric ENT specialist. They will guide you on the best course of action including decisions about whether surgery would be right for your nephew now, or if it should wait."}

The feelings of rage and irritation could be due to multiple causes which include hormonal changes, stress, mental health conditions like depression or anxiety, etc.\n\nHowever, it's important that you don't start any medication without proper evaluation. I would recommend consulting with a psychiatrist. You might benefit from some form of psychological therapy like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or even medications such as mood stabilizers or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors(SSRIs).\n\nThat being said, your current issues of irritability, extreme rage and desperation need urgent attention. If these feelings are accompanied by any thoughts of harm towards self or others, seek immediate help at nearest emergency room."}

I was wondering what would it be as I am worried if that is some kind of melanoma?", "output": "Moles are usually harmless and can change over time. However, given that your mole changes color when in contact with water and falls off to then regrow, I would recommend you have it examined by a dermatologist as soon as possible. Although it may not necessarily be malignant or cancerous such as melanoma, these characteristics do warrant further investigation. Please remember, it's always better to get any skin changes checked out early for peace of mind."}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,When I was 11 years old, I was knocked off my bike and cracked my front tooth in half horizontally, shortly after the dentist fixed it. Since then I have had no problems with it and had multiple x-rays to check on it. When it happened, the color of the tooth changed very slightly, to a very slightly more yellow shade than the rest of my teeth. I am curious to know what happened when the trauma occurred. Did my tooth die? What are they checking for when they x-ray the tooth?", "output": "Hello! Traumatic dental injuries can affect the tooth in various ways, depending on the severity of the injury. When you suffered your accident, it's possible that the impact affected the pulp inside the tooth - the living tissue containing blood vessels and nerves. This might have led to some discoloration. An x-ray after such an event would allow a dentist to see any damage that isn't visible from the outside, such as fractures that extend into the root or potential damage to the surrounding bone.\n\nThe concern is that if the pulp was significantly injured, it could result in pulp necrosis, essentially meaning the tooth \"dies\" because its vital tissues are no longer healthy. Dead or dying pulpal cells can leak out, staining the dentin within the tooth, thus causing further discoloration. However, given that you've reported no other symptoms (like pain or discomfort), it's likely that your tooth pulp survived the trauma or at least didn't die immediately, especially since the dentist repaired it promptly!\n\nDuring subsequent check-ups and x-rays, they probably wanted to make sure there were no signs of infection or abscesses forming, which could be complications if the tooth had indeed died and not been treated properly. The fact that you've experienced no major complications since then suggests that the interventions were successful!"}

I consulted with my orthodontist and temporarily removed the wires on two occasions. Both times, the ringing went down after some weeks. When I put on again, the sound started. One ENT I consulted said it could be an allergy to dust in the area I live in. Based on the information I received and the symptoms, I am not sure how to proceed. What is the cause of this issue?", "output": "Your symptoms sound like tinnitus, which is defined as the perception of noise or ringing in the ears. It's a common problem that affects about 15 to 20 percent of people and is often associated with some level of hearing loss, but it can also be related to stress, ear infection, medications, exposure to loud noises, and certain medical conditions.\n\nIt is interesting that you note an association between wearing your braces and the start of the sound. While there's no established direct link between orthodontic treatment and tinnitus, dental issues such as teeth grinding (bruxism), misalignment of the jaw joints (temporomandibular joint disorder - TMJ), or muscle tension could potentially contribute.\n\nThe advice from the ENT doctor could also be possible as allergies may lead to eustachian tube dysfunction, leading to ear fullness and tinnitus. \n\nGiven your unique situation, I suggest you discussing this again with both your ENT specialist and your orthodontist, possibly having them collaborate if necessary. This way they can create a more specific plan tailored just for you and help figure out exactly what may be causing your symptoms. You might benefit from visiting a dentist specializing in TMJ disorders as well. Make sure to mention any other symptoms you have so they can evaluate you thoroughly.\n"}

After going through a Holter test, I found that my heart rate increases and slows down with a pause of 1.8 seconds. My minimal heart rate is 50 and the maximum is 144 BPM. My average heart rate is 89. Is there anything serious?More details about the presenting complaint include I rarely get a headache with no other symptoms. I am currently taking Razel Gold once a day. In the past, I have been on Concor 5 mg once a day and Razel Gold once a day. I have gone through TMT three to four months ago with a normal outcome. The doctor also did an echocardiogram and everything seemed normal. Please help.", "output": "Based on the symptoms you have described, it seems like you may be experiencing a heart rhythm disorder, possibly atrial fibrillation or paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT). However, without actually examining your Holter test results and consulting with you in-person, I cannot definitively diagnose your condition.\n\nYour history of cardiac bypass surgery puts you at an increased risk for heart rhythm disorders. The irregular heart rhythm coupled with a pause of 1.8 seconds could indicate a problem, despite the lack of other symptoms typically associated with these conditions (like dizziness, shortness of breath, chest discomfort etc.).\n\nTo manage this situation carefully, you should consult your cardiologist promptly. You may be recommended to undergo further tests such as a stress echocardiogram or electrophysiology study. Depending upon the test results, treatment options can include medication, lifestyle changes, cardioversion, or potentially a procedure called ablation that helps correct heart rhythm problems.\n\nDon't panic \u2013 many people live normal lives with heart rhythm disorders, especially when properly diagnosed and treated. It's important, though, that you address this issue with your medical team."}

I think, I have it for a number of years and now I am a bit anxious about what it could be. Thank you.", "output": "Hello! It sounds like what you're describing could be a mole, which is usually harmless and happens when skin cells grow in a cluster instead of being spread throughout your skin. They can develop anywhere on your body, including your feet.\n\nAlthough most moles are non-cancerous, it's important to monitor them for changes. This could include things like growth, change in color or shape, asymmetry, irregular borders, or becoming painful or itchy.\n\nSince you said that this mole hasn't changed over years and you haven't noticed anything unusual about it besides its existence, it likely doesn't pose any risk. However, if you're concerned, it's always best to consult with a dermatologist or primary care physician who can examine the mole in person and provide you with an accurate diagnosis.\n\nSeeing a doctor will help ease your anxiety and ensure healthful practices. Even though it may not seem dangerous at the moment, regular check-ups in the future would be beneficial as part of preventive medicine."}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,I am 35 years old. My period was a month back. It sustained for four days. I generally use 3 to 4 pads in my periods. I had sex 10 days later.

I noticed my period 12 days later, though it lasted for four days, the period was less and usually, my period happens four days earlier. In this month, it was six days earlier. I did hCG beta blood test. I am sending you the report. Can I be pregnant or conceive? Please advise because I want to abort. I am an unmarried woman. Can the blood test be wrong? What laboratory test I should do to get to know whether the fetus is there beyond uterus (ectopic pregnancy) as I m 35+. When should I go for ultrasound vagina testing to get the true picture? After that I did not have any sex, so then again can I be pregnant and that could not be detected now and can be detected on later?", "output": "You've mentioned a few things here, let's try to address each one. \n\nFirstly, the Ovral G you took is an oral contraceptive pill which can be used as emergency contraception if taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex. So if you had taken that appropriately, it would decrease the chances of conception.\n\nSecondly, the change in your cycle and the lighter period may very well be due to the hormonal changes caused by taking Ovral G.\n\nThe Beta hCG blood test is a reliable way to determine pregnancy around 10 days after ovulation or one week after missed periods. If this test came out negative, and there hasn't been further sexual activity, then it's unlikely that you're pregnant. However, errors in lab tests may happen but are rare.\n\nRegarding checking for ectopic pregnancy, a transvaginal ultrasound is typically useful after five weeks from last menstrual period (or one week after a missed period) as it can help determine location of fetus.\n\nPlease remember, though, that an ultrasound should be performed under guidance of a healthcare professional and based on symptoms and clinical judgement as asymptomatic women have low risk of ectopic pregnancy.\n\nIt\u2019s important to consult with your personal doctor or gynecologist to supervise all these procedures and guide you through this time. These sources of information shouldn't replace a consultation with your personal health care provider."}

It is itchy at times and it has bled (small spots) as I am sure from the itching. I am worried it is skin cancer. Can you help?", "output": "Yes, it's very important to get this checked out further. Moles that change size, color or shape, become itchy and especially moles that bleed could potentially be melanoma, a type of skin cancer. However, only a detailed checkup and a biopsy can confirm the nature of your mole. Please visit a dermatologist as soon as possible for an in-person evaluation. Remember, the earlier potential skin cancers are identified, the better their treatment outcomes usually are.\n\nMeanwhile, try not to scratch the mole even if it's itchy because scratching may exacerbate symptoms and cause further bleeding. Of course, this advice doesn't substitute seeing a doctor, but should help until you manage to go."}

One question is when the first eye heals, do I need to protect it from re-infection from the one that is still healing?Also, on the typical length of healing, I am not quite at two weeks yet (this is day 11 for the first eye), but the lack of improvement in my condition is becoming frustrating to me. Today the vision in the first eye is smudgy, and the vision in the second eye is better, but not perfect.

Am I impatient or should I have them looked at by a specialist again?", "output": "Sorry to hear you're going through such discomfort. Viral conjunctivitis, also known as pink eye, can indeed be very frustrating due to its potentially prolonged course of illness and its ability to spread to the other eye.\n\nTo answer your first question about reinfection, while it is theoretically possible to \"re-infect\" one eye from another with viral particles, this isn't usually a significant issue. The immune system would have already started producing antibodies against the virus in your affected eyes, making re-infection less likely.\n\nViral conjunctivitis often lasts anywhere between 1-3 weeks but can extend up to 4-6 weeks or more, especially in severe cases. It sounds like you are still within the typical healing time range.\n\nVision changes during an episode of viral conjunctivitis are common due to corneal involvement (the clear window on the front of our eye that can get inflamed during the infection) and it's relatively normal to experience variable vision quality.\n\nWhile it is entirely reasonable for you to feel impatient given the discomfort and uncertainty surrounding the recovery timeline, at nearly 2 weeks into the illness, you are still well within normal healing times. However, if your symptoms worsen dramatically, your vision changes significantly, or the pain increases, then I would suggest seeking further evaluation sooner rather than later.\n\nRemember that hand hygiene is absolutely crucial in the management of viral conjunctivitis; frequent washing can help prevent the spread of the virus to other people"}

The blisters you describe could be due to multiple causes, and it's vital that we look into them properly.\n\n1) Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs): Since you have been sexually active, there is a possibility these could be related to an STI such as Genital herpes or HPV. They usually present with painless sores/bumps on the penis.\n \n2) Folliculitis: This is inflammation of hair follicles, which can sometimes cause bumps similar to what you're describing.\n   \n3) Friction Blisters: Excessive masturbation or sex can lead to friction-related injury leading to development of painless blisters.\n  \nYou need to visit your health care provider or a sexual health clinic for an examination. The doctor might ask for a swab test from the blister or a blood test to diagnose STIs.

Given that you've had contact with someone who was recently diagnosed with tuberculosis (TB), getting a PPD skin test is an appropriate step.\n\nThe PPD skin test involves injecting a small amount of purified protein derivative, a substance from the TB bacterium, under your skin. After 48-72 hours, a healthcare professional will examine the site of injection. A hard, raised red bump at the site may be indicative of a positive reaction, potentially suggesting TB infection.\n\nIf your test result appears positive, additional tests such as a chest X-ray and a test of sputum sample may be required for confirmation because PPD skin tests can sometimes give false-positive results especially in those who has been vaccinated with BCG vaccine.\n\nWhile direct physical evidence is crucial, if you're experiencing symptoms like persistent cough, chest pain, weight loss, fatigue, fever, night sweats, or loss of appetite, it's best to discuss with your health provider promptly.\n\nRemember: although TB is contagious, it doesn't spread easily unless you've been in close contact with the person's saliva droplets through activities such as living in the same household or working in the same close quarters for an extended time period.\n"}

Sometimes body anxiety can manifest as physical symptoms (like chest and back pain), however gastritis or acid reflux could also possibly lead to such discomfort. \n\nIf you are experiencing persistent chest pain and backache, you should revisit your doctor for further check-up. It's important to look at other potential issues as well. Conditions like gallbladder diseases, pancreatitis, peptic ulcer disease and even stress can cause similar symptoms and can be verified with appropriate testing. Another thing might be Musculoskeletal strains in the chest and back which are fairly common and may cause symptoms of chest/back ache as well.\n\nIn any case, without being able to examine you or having full access to your medical history and reports, I would advise you to follow up with your healthcare provider who can provide guidance based on a complete understanding of your health situation. Remember healthy lifestyle choices including balanced diet and regular exercise can also greatly contribute towards reducing these risks."}

His blood test revealed elevated bilirubin level. Four days later, his blood values become normal. On the same day, suddenly there was swelling on his body. The biochemistry examination revealed urine spot protein to creatinine ratio 2.19 and moderate grade proteinuria.", "output": "It sounds like your nephew may have a condition known as neonatal nephrotic syndrome, which is a rare disorder where a baby's kidneys are not functioning properly. In this condition, too much protein is passed into the urine, which can lead to swelling of the body due to fluid buildup. The prematurity could make him more susceptible to medical conditions and complications, such as problems with glucose regulation and jaundice (which might explain the elevated bilirubin levels).\n\nAnother possibility in premature babies could be Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA). It's a persistent opening between two major blood vessels leading from the heart, often associated with prematurity. It could present with signs of fluid overload including edema or swelling.\n\nNonetheless, you should continue working closely with his pediatrician or neonatologist, who may recommend medication, changes in diet, or other treatments based on the severity of the symptoms and the overall health of your nephew.

{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,Why some men cannot grow full beards? Explain why some men are not capable of growing full beards, and can only manage thin, patchy ones. Is this due to testosterone and genetics or something more? How does not being able to grow a full beard potentially impact men psychologically? Can this be emasculating for men or cause issues with self-esteem? Is there anything patchy men can do?", "output": "The ability to grow a full beard is largely determined by genetics and hormonal factors. Men's facial hair growth primarily relies on two hormones: testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Higher levels of these hormones increase the likelihood of growing thicker, fuller beards. However, it's not just about the level of these hormones but also how your body responds to them; this response is usually genetically programmed.\n\nSome men may have lower levels of these hormones or their hair follicles may be less sensitive to these hormones, resulting in thinner, patchy beard growth. There are other conditions also that can lead to sparse facial hair growth like alopecia areata, certain nutritional deficiencies, underlying diseases or infections, etc., but generally, it's genetic influence and hormone-related.\n\nPsychologically speaking, societal norms and stereotypes play a major role in how men perceive themselves when they cannot grow a full beard. Since beards are often associated with masculinity, some men might feel emasculated or less manly if they struggle to grow one. This could potentially impact their self-esteem or self-confidence, especially in societies where thick beards are revered as a sign of virility.\n\nIf a man wishes to enhance his facial hair growth, there are a few measures he could consider. Proper nutrition, practicing good skincare habits, and maintaining overall health can positively affect hair growth. Minoxidil (well known under the brand-name Rogaine) has shown anecdotally positive results for facial hair growth, though it's"}

Canker Sore: Also known as aphthous ulcers, these small shallow lesions can develop in the tissues of your mouth or at the base of your gums. They are not contagious but can be painful.\n\n2. Oral Herpes: Caused by HSV type 1, may present as sores (cold sores) in the mouth. \n\n3.

Trauma or Irritation: This could include injury from a sharp piece of food or heat burn from hot drink/food.\n\n5. Mononucleosis: An infection with symptoms including severe sore throat, fatigue, swollen lymph nodes and glands, and swelling in the roof of the mouth.\n\n6. Early signs of oral cancer: It's much less likely but should always be ruled out especially if you use tobacco, consume alcohol heavily, or have a history of HPV. \n\nConsidering these possibilities, it's crucial to see a healthcare provider who can diagnose the cause accurately.

As a medical professional, I can explain that angiography is indeed usually performed in individuals suffering from ischemic heart disease due to blocked arteries. The procedure aims to confirm and locate any blockage or narrowing in the coronary arteries. Stenting - which involves inserting a small tube into a blocked passageway to keep it open - is often recommended as a treatment following an angiography that reveals significant blockages.\n\nBeing a diabetic patient with high blood pressure, these factors significantly increase the risk of heart diseases such as Ischaemic Heart Disease (IHD). The presence of diabetes also makes the \"atherosclerotic plaque\" more unstable and prone to rupture leading to an acute cardiac event. \n\nGiven her diagnosis, she may benefit from various treatment options available for IHD including drug therapy (nitroglycerin, beta-blockers), lifestyle modifications (diet and exercise) and surgical intervention (stent placement or bypass surgery).

Now, do I need to do an HIV test to check?", "output": "Using a condom correctly does significantly reduce the risk of HIV transmission, but it's not 100% guaranteed due to possible breakage or improper use. Getting tested after potential exposure is advisable both for your peace of mind and because early diagnosis of HIV allows more effective treatment. Do remember that HIV takes time to detect in a majority of tests (up to 3 months) so you might want to discuss correct timing with a healthcare provider. Always make sure to engage in protected sex, try to know the status of your partner if possible, and consider undergoing regular testing if you're sexually active with multiple partners. Lastly, you could also consider taking pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a medication which significantly reduces the risk of HIV infection, if you find yourself having high-risk sex often.

In many cases, thorough cleaning is enough to deal with minor dental infections, although antibiotics may be prescribed in more severe cases.\n\nPost-extraction swelling and redness can be normal after such procedure, especially considering the number of teeth you've had removed. This should reduce over the course of a few days. However, if you notice increasing pain, bad odor, yellow pus or lymph node swelling, this could suggest an infection and you should contact your doctor or dentist as soon as possible.\n\nDry socket is a condition where the blood clot that normally forms and aids healing after extraction is dislodged or dissolves, leaving the bone and nerves exposed. This usually leads to significant discomfort or pain starting 2-3 days post-removal. The pain can often extend (radiates) beyond the surgical area to other parts of the face.\n\nWhile occasional mild pain might simply be part of the normal recovery process, sustained or severe pain is not and warrants prompt medical attention.\n\nContinue proper oral hygiene regimen but avoid vigorous rinsing or using straws for few days as these activities could disrupt the healing process.

Frequent colds can be attributed to a variety of factors:\n\n- Exposure: Regular contact with children, people with colds, crowded places like schools or public transport and sharing items with someone who has a cold increases your chances of catching one.\n\n- Weak immune system: If your immunity is compromised, due to stress, poor nutrition, or lack of sleep, it might become hard for your body to fight off the virus causing the common cold. \n\n- Season: During winter, people spend more time indoors in close proximity to each other, facilitating the spread of cold viruses. The low humidity during these months also dries out nasal passages making them more susceptible to infections.\n\n2. There are several ways you can reduce the risk of getting frequent colds:\n\n- Practice good hygiene: Always wash your hands before eating, after using the restroom, and when you come home from being outside. This reduces the chance of spreading the virus.\n\n- Strengthen your immune system: Eat plenty of fruits, vegetables and lean proteins. Exercise regularly and get adequate sleep.\n\n- Avoid sick people: Where possible try not to interact too closely with people who have a cold.\n   \n- Keep surfaces clean: Viruses that cause the common cold can live on surfaces.

These issues can cause pain, tingling and heaviness in the breast, arm and armpit areas.\n\nHowever, these symptoms might also be related to mammary duct ectasia, which is a noncancerous breast condition that occurs when a milk duct beneath your nipple widens, its walls thicken and it fills with fluid. This can create inflammation, possible infection and sometimes a mass.\n\nAnother potential cause could be hormonal fluctuations linked to your menstrual cycle, although given the severity and duration of your symptoms this may be less likely.\n\nBreast or armpit pain, unusual sensations of tingling and numbness, while may not be due to serious conditions like cancer, are always worth getting checked out promptly by a healthcare professional. Please make an appointment to see your doctor right away for further evaluation and proper diagnosis.\n\nPlease remember this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific causes may not apply to your situation. Always consult with a healthcare provider for appropriate examinations, treatment, testing, and care recommendations."}

This can lead to discomfort during sexual activity or difficulty maintaining cleanliness below the foreskin. \n\nMild cases can often be treated conservatively with the use of steroid creams and gentle daily retraction exercises. More severe cases might need surgical intervention like circumcision or preputioplasty. It's crucial to get checked by a health professional as soon as possible. They can make an accurate diagnosis and provide suitable treatment options for you. However, do not try to force your foreskin back if it leads to pain or bleeding, as you risk developing further complications.\n"}

Also, my penis is circumcised. So, my penile glans are dry and insensitive. Is there any topical cream available to increase the sensitivity of my penis? Is L arginine cream effective? Please suggest some medicines without side effects.", "output": "Low sexual drive can be attributed to a range of physical and mental factors, including low testosterone levels, stress, depression, or other underlying health conditions. It's crucial first to identify the root cause before starting any medication. Consult with your doctor or a sex therapist for specific treatment options.\n\nAs for medicines, some are available like Testosterone replacement therapy that could potentially help. However, these treatments should always be looked at as a last resort because they do carry potential negative side effects. Furthermore, these treatments need professional supervision.\n\nRegarding penile sensitivity, you might want to try moisturizing regularly with unscented lotions or oils. There's no hard evidence to suggest that L-Arginine cream will increase sensitivity - it is typically used more to improve blood flow.\n\nIn the case of all medications, there's generally always a risk of mild to severe side effects. I highly recommend discussing this in detail with your physician who can guide you about safe options according to your overall health status.\n\nRemember, lifestyle factors such as maintaining a healthy diet, regular exercise, avoiding alcohol, tobacco, and illicit substances, and managing stress through techniques like mindfulness and meditation can significantly impact your libido. Counseling or behavioural therapy may also be beneficial in certain cases."}

The fact that these appeared after you had a cut on your finger could suggest a possible bacterial infection, such as impetigo or cellulitis, especially if the redness is spreading around where you got the cut.\n\nAllergic reactions can also cause red spots and itching. This can occur due to contact with certain metals, soaps, plants, or substances.\n\nIt could also be something dermatological like psoriasis, eczema, or some form of dermatitis. \n\nHowever, without seeing these spots and assessing their pattern, color, size etc., it's hard to give a definitive diagnosis. It would be best for you to visit a healthcare professional in-person. They may refer you to a dermatologist, who specializes in conditions related to the skin.

Previously, I used to have Nexum and Librax. I have also got my ultrasound done.", "output": "Hi, it's important to note that without performing an actual exam or seeing your results, I can only give general advice. Gallbladder disease often includes conditions such as gallbladder inflammation, gallstone formation, and dysfunction in releasing bile due to blockage. Symptoms usually consist of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, bloating, and jaundice.\n\nSince your tests showed a thick-walled, non-functioning, sludge-filled gallbladder but no stone or pericholecystic fluid, you likely have biliary dyskinesia (gallbladder dysmotility) or chronic cholecystitis. The Nexum (esomeprazole) previously prescribed was presumably meant to control stomach acid production and reduce symptoms; Librax is commonly used for gastrointestinal spasms which could also be related to your condition.\n\nHomeopathic treatments may provide temporary symptom relief for some people, but there are not enough rigorous scientific studies demonstrating their effectiveness in treating gallbladder disease. There's also ongoing debate over their ability to alter the natural course of these diseases. If your current treatment isn't mitigating your symptoms or if they're getting worse, consider reaching out to your doctor to discuss further options.\n\nSurgical removal (cholecystectomy) is sometimes recommended for patients with repeated episodes of symptomatic gallbladdder disease, uncontrolled discomfort, complications like gallstones causing pancreatitis, or in cases when cancer is suspected.

Moreover, if there has been recent heavy lifting, repetitive arm movements, or if you have poor posture, these could also exacerbate your discomfort.\n\nAs your pain seems to have increased recently and is causing movement difficulty, it's strongly advised that you seek professional medical help promptly. You may require imaging tests like an x-ray or MRI for a definitive diagnosis. \n\nRemember not to self-medicate without proper consultation. Inappropriate medication can lead to side effects and might mask the underlying condition that needs to be addressed.

The pain is continuous. It is not resting for a minute, but the amount of pain varies sometimes a lot sometimes a little.I am 25 years old male. I was so active with all the sports activity and all, for last one year. After I bought my bike I stopped playing most of the sports, also the walking came down to below average because of the bike. Does the less walking have something to do with all that I am suffering? I had two to three accidents with my bike, but none of them were serious ones. I mean I did not get hurt badly. Just some scratches on my hand. So I am confused if the condition is done from a trauma. The doctors asked me to take one month rest and physiotherapy at this moment. Please suggest me what to do, I am really worried if it is sciatica or something even greater. I only want to heal the issue, recover from it completely even if that takes me one year or two.", "output": "Based on your description, it's likely that you might be suffering from post-laminectomy syndrome, also known as failed back surgery syndrome. This condition is characterized by persistent pain following back surgeries.\n\nSciatica could also be a possibility given the radiation of pain to your legs, but it would generally only affect one side rather than both. The fact that your pain is continuous and fluctuates in intensity could indeed indicate nerve involvement.\n\nYour lifestyle changes can definitely impact your recovery. Regular physical activity, including walking, promotes blood flow which aids healing. It improves muscle strength and flexibility which are crucial for back health, so reducing this could conceivably exacerbate issues.\n\nWhile bike accidents may not seem severe initially, they can cause injury to the spine or contribute to existing conditions due to the jarring forces involved. \n\nYour doctors' current suggestion for rest and physiotherapy sounds appropriate at this stage. Physical therapy is crucial after spinal fusion surgery to regain strength and mobility.\n\nI would suggest getting a second opinion if possible, preferably from a doctor specializing in spinal disorders. They might recommend further imaging to rule out other potential causes like disc herniation or nerve sheath tumors.\n\nIn terms of what you can do personally: continue with prescribed physical therapies, maintain light-to-moderate activity levels when possible without causing pain flare-ups, consider over-the-counter anti-inflammatories and pain medicines (after verifying with your healthcare provider), and try heat/cold therapy.\n\nYou must remember that recovery from these types of injuries"}

However, remember that this advice is quite generic and might not necessarily apply to your situation. It\u2019s also very important to avoid itching as much as you can since scratching can complicate the condition by introducing new bacteria into the area.\n\nPlease keep in mind that even though these actions might alleviate symptoms, they don't treat underlying conditions and a thorough examination by a doctor is still necessary.

It's important to contact your doctor who can help you evaluate current treatments, adjust dosages, or suggest alternative interventions.\n\nIf Trazodone and Melatonin are not helpful tonight, you might want to try some non-medical interventions:\n\n1. Sleep hygiene - regular sleep schedule, good bedtime routine, avoiding electronics before bed, etc.\n2. Relaxation exercises - such as deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation before bed.\n3. Make sure your bedroom is cool, dark and quiet.\n\nSecondary insomnia (which is caused by underlying conditions, like mental health disorders, certain medications, or other substances) often improves once the underlying cause is treated. Primary insomnia (insomnia without a known cause) varies widely from person to person, it could last weeks, months or even longer in some cases.\n\nAs for whether insomnia is associated with anything fatal? Extended periods of severe sleep deprivation could increase risk of conditions like hypertension, diabetes, obesity, heart attack, stroke, psychological issues, impaired immune function and so on.

She did pregnancy test today morning again; it came negative. We are confused and worried if she is pregnant. She has PCOD also. She had her last periods 45 days back. Do we have to go for a blood test?", "output": "As a doctor, I can confirm that Home Pregnancy Tests (HPTs) are typically very accurate if done correctly and at the appropriate time, which is usually after a missed period. That being said, in some cases, the test can give a false negative especially if done too early. Vomiting sensation, lack of appetite, light stomach cramps, and fever could be due to various reasons like an infection or stress-related gastrointestinal issues.\n\nHowever, as your partner has Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), her menstrual cycle may not follow the typical 28-35 day pattern, making it difficult to predict ovulation and detect pregnancy based solely on her cycle dates. It's possible these symptoms could be due to hormonal fluctuations associated with PCOS, but given the unprotected intercourse, there still remains a possibility of pregnancy.\n\nIn this case, considering all the factors mentioned, I would advise you go for a blood test - a beta hCG test, which is more sensitive than HPT and can detect a pregnancy earlier and with more accuracy. Also, do consult a gynecologist regarding her current symptoms, irrespective of the pregnancy status. The healthcare provider can also look into managing her PCOS symptoms. Lastly, remember using protection will prevent unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections."}

Is jerky septum a normal finding?", "output": "A \"jerky septum\" usually refers to a condition known as hypokinetic or dyskinetic septum movements. This isn't typically considered normal and often indicates some form of cardiac abnormality, such as conditions related to heart blockages, myocardial infarction, high blood pressure, cardiomyopathy, or bundle branch block among others.\n\nHowever, your tests show a normal echo with LVEF (Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction) at 50%, which is in the lower range of normal (normal range is about 50%-70%) and a dobutamine stress test negative for ischemia indicating a low risk for significant coronary artery disease. It's also good that your LVEF increased with stress, this represents good contractile reserve of the heart.\n\nNevertheless, I would suggest you to discuss these findings with your cardiologist so they can be put into context with any symptoms you may have or other aspects of your medical history and possibly further tests could be recommended.\nIt's worth noting that you have not stated why the echocardiogram study was initially performed, if there were symptoms like chest pain, breathlessness etc., then despite stress test results, additional investigations like cardiac MRI or even angiography might be required depending on individualized assessment. \n\nBottom line: While your tests indicate a largely healthy heart's function, the \"jerky septum\" observation could be associated with underlying health issues and warrants thorough discussion & follow-up with your physician."}

Over-the-counter solutions are temporary and often not effective on more severe dental issues either.\n\nI really advise that you see a dentist as soon as possible. If finances are an issue, there may be resources available in your area for free or low-cost dental care, such as dental schools or community health clinics.

This is a condition where stomach acid frequently flows back into the tube connecting your mouth and stomach (esophagus). This backwash (acid reflux) can irritate the lining of your esophagus causing heartburn which is characterized by burning sensation in the chest. It may also cause you to have sore throat and increased burping.\n\nLifestyle modifications are often enough to control symptoms of GERD: avoid fatty/spicy foods, eat smaller meals, avoid lying down or going to sleep immediately after meals, lose weight if overweight, stop smoking if applicable, and limit alcohol and caffeine consumption. Over-the-counter antacids may also help relieve your symptoms. \n\nHowever, should your symptoms persist, worsen, or if you start experiencing difficulty swallowing, prolonged hoarseness, or unexplained weight loss, I strongly recommend you to get further evaluations performed by a healthcare professional for appropriate diagnosis and treatment."}

In general, they are benign and often asymptomatic unless they grow particularly large or impinge on sensitive neurological structures. Hypoglossal nerve displacement due to an arachnoid cyst is quite unusual but it can happen. The hypoglossal nerve primarily controls the movement of the tongue, which would typically produce speech or swallowing problems rather than epilepsy if compromised.\n\nEpilepsy is mostly unrelated to displacement of the hypoglossal nerve by an arachnoid cyst. Epilepsy is typically caused by various factors that alter the normal pattern of neuronal activity including illness, brain damage, abnormal brain development or genetic influence. However, when seizures are particularly difficult to control with medication, an underlying structural brain anomaly like an arachnoid cyst may be part of the issue.\n\nIt's very important for a Neurologist or Neurosurgeon to review your brother's MRI images because there are many variables involved, such as actual size of the cyst, its precise location, whether it appears to be causing any pressure on brain tissue etc.\n\nRegarding his new medicine Epilive (also known as Levetiracetam), hallucinations and nightmares are recognized potential side effects.

The rate at which they will reduce ferritin levels can depend on multiple factors including your weight, the dosages prescribed, the frequency of administration, individual metabolism, and whether you continue to intake dietary iron.\n\nHowever, it is challenging to provide a precise assessment of how much one DFO IV session or each Exjade pill might reduce ferritin levels without more specific clinical data. Typically, these medications are monitored very closely by a medical professional who would adjust dosage based on frequent lab testing. \n\nOverall, trying to reduce ferritin levels without monitoring from a healthcare provider can be dangerous, potentially leading to anemia and other side effects when considering these types of treatments. If you have concerns about your iron levels, I'd highly recommend consulting with a hematologist for a personalized care plan."}

My wife does not want to undergo any more tests. Can we conclude that it is safe based on the reports? She had a similar problem about eight to nine years back and at that time also another doctor gave her Vitamin E tablets and the lumps disappeared. No tests were conducted that time. Please advise.", "output": "Without seeing the actual reports or results from your wife's tests, it is difficult for me to give a specific advise. But general guideline can be as follows:\n\nFirstly, it's very good news that her lumps have been classified as benign, and that they've disappeared after treatment with Vitamin E.\n\nHowever, often further testing is recommended merely as a precautionary measure after initial favorable results in order to ensure there are no hidden issues. This doesn't necessarily mean that there is any additional reason for concern, but to lasts as thorough proactive measures for patient's health. \n\nGiven your wife's age and history of similar concerns earlier, regular screening and follow up checks will be important even if she is currently symptom free, as breast conditions can change over time. Mammograms and ultrasounds (along with the previously done FNAC) could help identify changes early and monitor her condition properly.\n\nFinally, how frequent these tests should occur depends on her medical history and overall risk factors.

However, people with uncontrolled thyroid conditions, particularly those with Graves\u2019 disease, may have eye-related symptoms such as extreme dryness or bulging of the eyes which could potentially complicate surgery.\n\nAs with any medical procedure, it's important to discuss her individual case with her healthcare provider and ophthalmologist. They can provide the most accurate advice based on the current state of her health, including her thyroid condition and overall eye health.\n\nPost-LASIK, some patients might experience temporary swelling of the cornea, which is a normal part of the healing process. Symptoms like mild discomfort, itching, or watering of the usual last for a few hours to few days after surgery, but these are temporary and subside as the eye heals. Severe swelling or pain is rare, but if experienced post-surgery immediate medical attention should be sought.\n\nAdditionally, maintaining regular follow-ups post-surgery will help monitor the progression of recovery and address any complications at early stages if they occur. \n\nTo summarize, your partner can potentially undergo LASIK surgery despite having a thyroid condition, but this decision needs to be discussed thoroughly with her medical providers. Maintaining good control of her thyroid condition before and after surgery will be crucial."}

My cycle is usually 25 days and I have not got periods yet. I tested 10 times, all were negative. Should I go to gynecologist and request for an ultrasound? Will ultrasound detect early pregnancy?", "output": "The fact that you have taken a Plan B pill within 10 hours of intercourse significantly reduces the chance of pregnancy. These pills are most effective when taken promptly after unprotected sex. However, it is important to note that emergency contraception like Plan B can cause changes in your menstrual cycle, often delaying your period.\n\nHome pregnancy tests are generally highly accurate and become more reliable the longer you wait after your expected period date to test. If all your tests have come back negative, it's very likely that you aren't pregnant.\n\nIt would not be typically necessary to request for ultrasound at this point. Ultrasounds usually don't detect pregnancy until about five to six weeks gestation, which is around a week or so after your missed period. \n\nHowever, if you're feeling anxious or worried, there is no harm in contacting your gynaecologist for additional reassurance. They might perform other assessments based on your health history to rule out any underlying reason for the delayed period apart from the effect of Plan B."}

There is a history of rheumatoid arthritis in my family. Blood work is negative. Should I go to a rheumatologist?", "output": "Yes, you should definitely consult a rheumatologist. Although blood work is negative, some people with rheumatoid arthritis have normal blood tests. Your symptoms of morning stiffness, swelling and hard bumps called rheumatoid nodules are common in people with rheumatoid arthritis. Additionally, having a family history of rheumatoid arthritis puts you at an increased risk. It's also important to note that pregnancy can sometimes mask the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis due to increased levels of anti-inflammatory corticosteroids produced by your body during this time. When hormone levels start coming back down after childbirth, these masked symptoms may become apparent."}

I have mentioned only the ones who have the higher readings. Protein 1+ detected in dipstick, serum uric acid at 9.2 mg/dL, MPV at 12.5 fL, FBS at 112 mg/dL, HbA1c at 5.5, cholesterol at 227 mg/dL, triglycerides at 181 mg/dL, VLDL is at 36.2 mg/dL, ALT/SGPT at 48 U/L. Serum creatinine at 1.23, increased from 0.99 tested six months back. Other than this, all others were normal. I also have been infected with hepatitis B twice and vaccinated for hepatitis B. I have been a diabetic for more than two years. The HbA1c vary between 5.5 and 6.5. The first one was done two years ago. I also have hypertension for more than five years. It is not very much under control. It varies from 135/80 to 150/100 and now it has reduced a bit to 140/90. I met my general physician who advised me to check my albumin to creatinine ratio. I tested it four times. The results are as follows:  55 ug/mg, 150 mg/g, 11.4 ug/mg, 37.5 mg/g. My ultrasonogram revealed fatty liver and cystitis. All the rest is fine. My ECG was fine. I have been advised to have a urine culture. My current medications are Telma-AM 40, Dynaglipt, Ecosprin AV 75, Levofloxacin, and CTD 12.5 mg. I am not able to understand why my albumin levels are so high and I would like to know how and when can they be rectified. I have attached reports for your further reference.", "output": "The presence of high levels of albumin (protein) in your urine, revealed by the albumin to creatinine ratio tests and dipstick test, suggest that your kidneys aren't functioning properly. This condition is known as albuminuria or proteinuria and often occurs due to diabetes-related kidney disease (diabetic nephropathy) or hypertension. As you mentioned, you have been diabetic for more than 2 years and also suffer from uncontrolled blood pressure; these conditions may have contributed towards renal damage leading to increased urinary albumin.\n\nYour increased serum uric acid level may point towards gout or another metabolic disorder. High cholesterol and triglyceride levels raise cardiovascular risk factors, and combined with your uncontrolled blood pressure, require aggressive management.\n\nIt's advised generally to follow up on the cystitis (bladder inflammation) indicated by the ultrasonogram, as untreated infection can harm the kidneys over time.\n\nThe elevated ALT/SGPT level indicates liver stress or injury, which is not surprising considering the detected fatty liver. Viral hepatitis history may also influence this significantly.\n\nFor your condition, a multi-disciplinary approach involving a cardiologist, endocrinologist, and a nephrologist would probably be most beneficial. \n\nManagement will likely involve rigorous control of diabetes and blood pressure, dietary changes, exercise, proper hydration, and potentially further medication. Please consult with your healthcare providers to discuss these options. Keep in mind that reversing albuminuria totally might not be possible, but slowing its progress"}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,You were wonderful in allaying some health anxiety over some skin issues several months ago. So, I thought I would consult with you on another question pertaining to my son. Unfortunately, a combination of my health anxiety and the big mistake of searching online has my mind imagining the worst with regard to my son. My son is 19 years old and has no diagnosed medical issues. I noticed back when he was about eight or ten years old that he had a mark resembling a cafe au lait mark on his back, in the upper shoulder area. I had always asked the pediatrician to look at it during his yearly physicals, and they made nothing of it. Throughout the years it has grown a bit and has become darker and more rough in texture. It is probably slightly less than an inch in length and looks like a few small lesions grouped together. Again, I have brought it to the pediatrician\\s attention and he was not concerned. Three months ago, I made an appointment for him and my other son with a dermatologist for a skin exam, and I pointed out the spots which I wanted to be checked in particular. We met with the physician\\s assistant there, and my younger son had a peculiar spot I pointed out, of which the PA conducted a shave biopsy, which came back as a mildly atypical junctional nevus. For my older son, I pointed out the spot on his back/shoulder, and the PA diagnosed it as a linear epidermal nevus. She said the chances of it becoming dangerous are slim to none. It may darken throughout the years, and they will simply monitor it at yearly visits. Unfortunately, I went on to research online about epidermal nevi and of course I ran into information showing a possible link to epidermal nevus syndrome and all of its associated neurological and skeletal defects. As I said, he is 19 and has no medical issues, is extremely intelligent, etc. In your opinion, is it safe to say that I should not be concerned about those syndromes? I presume it is primarily related to the numerous and systemic epidermal nevi, which he does not have, and I would think it would have presented by now? And my last even more neurotic question. My online research led me to some information saying that a certain type of epidermal nevus could be related to a gene mutation that could be passed along to an offspring, with them having possible serious skin scaling conditions, etc. Again, he has just one solitary small epidermal nevus. No biopsy was done, as the PA did not feel it was necessary. Do you feel there is any need for me to worry about that potential genetic mutation? Thank you so much for reading my long query.", "output": "Hello, I'm glad that you found my previous consultation helpful and have returned back for further clarifications.\n\nTo answer your questions:\n\n1. Epidermal Nevus Syndrome characteristically presents early in childhood with numerous lesions (not just a single lesion), as well as possible neurological and eye abnormalities. Other systemic involvements can occur, but these are usually present before adolescence. Therefore, given your son's current age and overall good health status, it would be highly unlikely for him to develop Epidermal Nevus Syndrome at this point.\n\n2. While it's true that certain types of epidermal nevus can be associated with genetic mutations, these conditions typically involve more extensive skin involvement and other clinical features. A solitary linear epidermal nevus, like the one your son has, is usually not associated with any known genetic syndromes. It's also important to note that even if your son did have a syndrome associated with his epidermal nevus (which he very likely does not), most of these syndromes would not cause significant risk to his offspring because they're often sporadically occurring disorders, i.e., they're not hereditary.\n\nIn conclusion, while it's always good to stay informed about possible medical issues, it seems like there is no need to worry excessively about your son's health in this respect. That said, please do continue to observe annual dermatology appointments to monitor the condition, as advised by your dermatologist. \n\nThis advice doesn"}

Also, your overthinking and worrying can be a sign of anxiety. Stress, anxiety and lifestyle habits such as working late or at irregular hours can disrupt your body's natural sleep-wake cycle. Excessive use of nicotine (from smoking cigarettes) can also contribute to insomnia.\n\nHere are some initial suggestions to improve your sleep hygiene:\n\n1. Keep regular sleep schedule: Consistency is key for setting your \"internal clock\". Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends.\n2. Create a restful sleeping environment: This includes keeping your room dark, quiet, comfortable and cool.\n3. Limit daytime naps: Long or irregular napping can disrupt your natural sleep pattern. If you have to nap, limit yourself to about 20 to 30 minutes and make it during early afternoon.\n4. Regular physical activity: Regular physical activity can help you fall asleep faster and deepen your sleep. Try not to exercise close to bedtime because that might interfere with your sleep.\n5. Limit caffeine intake and avoid alcohol: Both can prevent deep sleep and frequently cause awakenings throughout the night.\n\nHowever, if these changes don't help, I highly recommend you consider seeking advice from a mental health professional or a sleep specialist, they may suggest cognitive behavioral therapy or medications.

If that were the case, you would typically have significant difficulties with physical activity such as vigorous exercise and running long distances. Instead, it seems that anxiety could be playing a major role in your perceived breathing issues.\n\nThe mind-body connection can often cause physical symptoms, such as the feeling shortness of breath or needing deep sighs, even when all tests come back normal. These symptoms might be more noticeable during rest or times of stress/anxiety rather than during physical exertion when your focus is elsewhere. \n\nConsider continuing the anxiety medications recommended by your doctor and perhaps exploring cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques to manage the sensation of breathlessness.

Considering your concerns and willingness for a second opinion, I would recommend discussing this further with another vascular specialist or cardiologist. They can review your condition comprehensively before deciding on the necessity of further intervention. It might also be helpful to discuss your depression with your physician since it appears to be impacting your ability to manage PAD through exercise.\n\nPlease remember that while these interventions carry their own risks, they are typically recommended only when the benefits outweigh the potential downsides.

You'll also want a thorough evaluation to rule out other possible conditions that can cause similar symptoms.\n \nTreatment usually involves increasing fluid and salt intake to increase blood volume, as well as exercises to improve circulation. Medications can also help manage the symptoms, but must be prescribed by a practitioner who is familiar with these conditions.\n\nUnfortunately, POTS and other dysautonomia are often overlooked and not well understood, so you might need to see a specialist;  preferably a cardiologist specializing in electrophysiology or a neurologist specializing in autonomic disorders for proper management.

{"instruction": "", "input": "Hi doctor,I am a 33 year old female. I have never smoked. I am not overweight and I do not have diabetes. I have been having some left leg issues. It started six months back. I started limping because my left calf, ankle and groin were hurting. My emergency Doppler venous ultrasound was clear. I had a D-dimer and that was negative. I had an MRI of my left ankle that showed a talofibular ligament sprain on my left ankle. I also had an arterial Doppler ultrasound that showed decreased flow of left anterior tibial artery and increased peak systolic velocity in the left common femoral artery. But, there was no stenosis, no sclerosis and no plaque. Could the sprain have caused that decreased flow? After three months, it became normal again. Then, while having pedicure the woman massaged my ankle and leg. Since then the pain has returned to my left ankle and left leg. I had another D-dimer done three weeks ago that was negative. I have also recently started experiencing cold left foot and a left cold lower leg at night. By morning, both the legs as well as the feet are of the same temperature. I do get pain in the buttocks and the pain is going down my leg like a sciatic pain on the left leg. Do I have peripheral artery disease? Could a blood clot be causing it? I have a four hours flight next week and I am worried about flying. Is it safe to fly? Would the arterial Doppler and D-dimer be able to tell if I have a blood clot in my artery? Or is a D-dimer just for the veins? My LDL was 10 points above normal in my last blood test. But, my doctor did not seem to be concerned as my HDL was high. I have attached the reports for your reference. Please help me.", "output": "Based on your description and the tests that you've undergone, it seems like Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) is less likely. Your arterial Doppler results didn't show any significant stenosis or plaque, which are common in PAD.\n\nThe recurring pain after a massage could be due to a re-injury of the previously sprained ligament in your ankle. The fact that your symptoms disappeared for a while and then resurfaced following a physical stimulus further supports this notion. \n\nThe symptom of having cold left foot and a cold lower leg at night but normalizing by morning may indicate nerve involvement, especially since you're also experiencing sciatic-like pain. This could potentially be something called radiculopathy where a nerve root in your spine is compressed causing similar symptoms.\n\nA D-dimer test is generally used to rule out clot formation, typically venous as in deep vein thromboses or pulmonary embolisms. However, it's important to remember that a negative D-dimer cannot entirely rule out the possibility of peripheral artery disease.\n\nGiven your age, lifestyle habits, and absence of several risk factors for arteriosclerotic diseases, the chances of having significant peripheral arterial disease sound low. But considering your current pain and upcoming travel, I recommend seeking immediate medical attention to further evaluate your symptoms and discuss whether flying would be safe.\n\nOnline forums can give you some guidance, but they don't replace a thorough evaluation from your physician who can take into consideration all details of your case, including"}

Her urine output is seven to eight times (volume is 1 to 1.5 liters within 24 hours). Can she avoid dialysis and reduced creatinine level? Please help.", "output": "I'm sorry to hear about your mother's condition. Chronic kidney disease with a creatinine level of 9.8 mg/dL indicates pretty severe kidney dysfunction, which is likely related to her long-standing diabetes and hypertension. Her body is not able to adequately clear the toxic waste from her blood, leading to these high levels.\n\nRegarding avoiding dialysis, it's tough. At this stage, most patients would be considered for dialysis or a kidney transplant. The primary goal is to reduce further damage to her kidneys, manage symptoms such as swelling and fatigue, and prevent complications like heart disease.\n\nIt's important to have regular consultations with her nephrologist who can determine if there are any additional measures that could help slow the progression of her kidney disease. Medications and lifestyle changes (like a low-protein, low-salt diet) may be helpful to ease some of the burden on her kidneys.\n\nUnfortunately, once the creatinine level reaches such a high point, it's challenging to lower it without procedures like dialysis or transplantation. Please consider having a discussion about the possibilities and risks associated with each treatment option. It may also be beneficial to seek a second opinion in situations like these where treatment decisions can greatly impact the quality of life."}

I would like to know if there is any permanent solution to cure otitis media as I have also heard it could cause meningitis. I am having another bout right now with my left ear drum is inflamed and this time Cefpodoxime cannot clear it. So, the specialist has put me on Cefuroxime. I am still on this course of antibiotics. I have back aches, cough with phlegm with low-grade fever and feel generally lethargic. I also have high-pitched tinnitus which is very loud. Can you please tell me if I can take a treatment where this issued can be fully resolved?", "output": "I understand that recurring otitis media can be very uncomfortable and I empathize with your situation. To eliminate persistent or recurrent middle ear infection, one might require surgery such as a myringotomy (a surgical procedure where a tiny incision is made in the eardrum to relieve pressure caused by excessive build-up of fluid) or tympanostomy (insertion of tube into the eardrum to keep the middle ear aerated for a prolonged period of time). This could help reduce the frequency and severity of infections.\n\nHowever, these decisions should always be discussed thoroughly with your ENT specialist after a thorough examination including audiometry tests. It's also crucial to investigate why you're having recurrent infections. Some people have issues with Eustachian tube function, contributing to negative pressure within the middle ear space and recurrent infections. Other medical problems like allergies, sinus disease, reflux, immune system disorders, etc could also contribute to this.\n\nIn regards to meningitis, yes, untreated or severe otitis media carries the risk of complications including meningitis although it is not common. That's why it's important we're treating each episode appropriately.\n\nAs for your current symptoms (backache, cough with phlegm, low-grade fever and lethargy), they may imply you are suffering from an upper respiratory tract infection or a form of systemic flu-like illness which itself might be causing otitis media as a secondary finding.

I used to go to the gym but due to this problem, I am not able to do all my activities. Recently, I had ECG, echo and stress test and blood tests all tests were normal but after 15 minutes of stress test I had chest pain five minutes and sweating for 20 minutes. My resting heart beat has also decreased. I was in anxiety two years back but my ECG at that time was better than this time.", "output": "Given your symptoms, I would advise you to seek immediate medical attention. Though you are young and have healthy habits, the combination of chest pain, left arm pain, jaw pain, and shortness of breath can indicate serious heart-related conditions such as angina or even a heart attack. Your normal test results are reassuring but they do not completely rule out cardiac disease. It is also possible that these symptoms could be related to other non-cardiac issues such as anxiety, gastrointestinal conditions, muscle strain among others. \n\nHowever, it's important to remember that in emergency cases like potential heart conditions, it's better to be safe than sorry. Visit an emergency department immediately so that quick diagnostic tests can be done. Your doctor might need more specialized exams such as coronary angiography, nuclear stress testing, or coronary CT angiography.\n\nAlso, having dealt with anxiety previously there may be a psychological component to your symptoms. Chest pain and other physical symptoms can sometimes be triggered by panic attacks or severe anxiety, known as somatoform disorders. However, this diagnosis should only be considered after ruling out any dangerous physical conditions. Consulting with a psychiatrist or psychologist might be beneficial once any life-threatening conditions have been ruled out."}

When I touch my cheek, pain shoots down to my tooth and I do not know what this means.", "output": "It sounds like you have a dental abscess. A hole in the tooth allows bacteria to enter into the pulp tissue and can eventually lead to an infection, which may spread into the jaw bone surrounding the roots of the affected tooth causing swelling on your cheek and sensitivity. The pain you're describing is likely due to this inflammation and infection. Please seek immediate dental care to get the tooth properly managed. You may need antibiotics to control the infection and possibly procedures such as root canal treatment or even extraction if deemed necessary by your dentist. Never neglect oral hygiene habits and use fluoride-based products as preventive measures against similar events happening in future."}

Kindly suggest me a second opinion.", "output": "Based on your description, it sounds like you could have a condition known as pulpitis -- inflammation of the dental pulp which is often very sensitive to hot or cold food and drinks. Even if the X-ray doesn't show any visible problem with the tooth structure itself, the pulp (innermost part of the tooth) can still be inflamed causing pain.\n\nThere are two types of pulpitis: reversible and irreversible. In reversible pulpitis, pain is usually triggered by hot, cold, or sweet stimuli and ceases once the stimulus is removed. Whereas in irreversible pulpitis, the pain often persists after removal of the stimulus.\n\nUltimately, diagnosis and appropriate treatment should be confirmed by a visit to another dentist for a second opinion. If it's reversible pulpitis, treatment typically involves removing the source of irritation and putting a temporary filling to calm the pulp down. If it's irreversible pulpitis, more extensive procedures may be required such as root canal therapy. \n\nAlso, if you have not had a recent cleaning, sometimes tartar buildup can cause sensitivity especially close to gumline. May not be seen on an xray if it\u2019s under the gums.\n\nIt would also be beneficial to discuss with them other conditions that might not necessarily appear on an X-ray image, such as trigeminal neuralgia or temporomandibular joint disorder.

I have a broken tooth in the back left bottom. My front tooth appears green, and they are deeply separated. Is there any way available to save my tooth?", "output": "Yes, in most cases it is possible to save a tooth. Your situation sounds complex and will likely require professional intervention - both from a dentist (for oral health) and possibly an orthodontist (for tooth spacing). \n\nFor the green discoloration issue, this may be due to a variety of reasons like bacterial infection, medications or metal fillings etc. An antioxidant-rich diet might help slightly with discoloration, but it typically requires professional cleaning or possibly veneers/crowns.\n\nThe broken tooth will also need attention as it can lead to further damage if left untreated. It might need a crown, filling, or root canal treatment depending on how extensively it's broken.\n\nSpacing problems generally require braces or aligners, but recent developments have greatly improved this process. You could consider clear aligners, which are nearly invisible but perform similar work to braces.\n\nRemember, these are potential treatments.

If traditional treatment options have not been providing relief, it may be time to discuss more intensive interventions with a specialist such as an orthopedic surgeon or a rheumatologist. Here are several options you might consider:\n\n1. Cortisone Injections: This powerful anti-inflammatory can often relieve pain and inflammation caused by bursitis when other treatments fail.\n\n2. Physical Therapy: A physical therapist could provide specific exercises to strengthen the surrounding muscles, advice on proper footwear, possible usage of heel lifts or shoe inserts.\n\n3. Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy (ESWT): This involves using sound waves to stimulate your body's own healing process.\n\n4. Surgery: In some severe or persistent cases, removing the inflamed bursa surgically might be considered.\n\n5. Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) therapy: This is a newer treatment option and involves injecting your own platelets into the affected area to promote healing.\n\n6. Lifestyle modifications: maintaining a healthy weight to reduce pressure on heels, avoid activities causing heel pain.\n\n7.

It can be caused by various issues affecting sperm production or the transport of sperm. \n\nFSH (Follicle-Stimulating Hormone), LH (Luteinizing Hormone), and testosterone are all hormones that play critical roles in male reproduction system:\n- FSH stimulates the Sertoli cells in the testes to facilitate sperm production.\n- LH stimulates Leydig cells in the testes to produce testosterone.\n- Testosterone plays an essential role in the development of male reproductive tissues such as the testes and prostate.\n\nIn your case, High levels of FSH and LH with a lower testosterone level could indicate primary testicular failure; this means that the issue lies within the testicles themselves. High FSH suggests that your body is trying to stimulate the testes to produce sperm but, for some reason, they're not responding adequately. And high LH but relatively low Testosterone also indicates the testes are not producing sufficient amount of testosterone despite stimulation. \n\nBut precise interpretation should be done by your treating physician taking into account overall physical evaluation and medical history.

They told me she is long sighted and we have a strong family history of squints and glasses. I do not know if I should get a second opinion.", "output": "Based on your daughter's symptoms of inward-turning eye (a condition also referred to as esotropia, which could be a type of squint/strabismus) and her complaints of eye discomfort while watching TV, it certainly concerns me. The test results you provided indicate she is indeed farsighted (hyperopia). This condition could lead children to over-focus or 'over-accommodate' in an attempt to see clearly, which can then cause the eyes to cross inward.\n\nFarsightedness and family history of strabismus are risk factors for developing convergent squints. Farsightedness requires the focusing muscles inside the eye to work harder to bring things into focus and this extra effort can sometimes result in crossing of the eyes especially during tasks like reading, close work, or fatigue.\n\nGlasses might correct her vision and help to realign her eyes when they're worn consistently, thereby reducing her symptoms and potentially addressing the cause of the squint itself. It's always a good idea in cases including a squint, to discuss treatment options with a pediatric ophthalmology specialist. \n\nGetting a second opinion can certainly help if you feel uncertain, but please note that consistent follow-up with her doctor will be essential even after glasses prescription, to monitor the response and adjust the strength or consider other interventions if necessary."}

She received a cast after the diagnosis of a fracture of the tip of the ulna.We would like to have a second opinion based on the attached images, especially whether other damage can be identified on the radius or other wrist bones, and whether more invasive treatment is necessary. Swelling and pain have experience on both sides of the wrist (radius and ulna), but the movement of fingers, including the thumb, did not incur further pain. The swinging of the hand sideways or up and down was also possible and without increased pain.

For a thorough second opinion, you should consult with another healthcare professional who can physically view the X-Ray.\n\nGenerally, fractures of the distal end of the ulna are usually managed non-surgically with immobilization in a cast or splint. It typically takes about 4-6 weeks to heal. The fact that there is no increased pain during finger movements or hand swinging is promising. Additionally, lack of numbness or circulation issues suggest there is probably not any significant nerve or blood vessel injury. However, the persistence of swelling and pain on both sides of the wrist may indicate additional injury beyond the ulna fracture that was identified.\n\nIt would be wise to get a second opinion from an orthopedic specialist who could read the X-rays, perform a full clinical examination, and weigh in on rehab strategies to maintain flexibility and strength as she recovers.

Other possible causes for persistent lymphadenopathy include autoimmune diseases, benign lymph node hyperplasia, certain medications, chronic skin conditions, and some forms of systemic inflammation.\n\nIt's good that you're staying vigilant about your health by getting all these tests done. However, just based on the information provided, I would say chances of this being cancer are low. I suggest continuing to work closely with your healthcare provider to determine the exact cause and appropriate treatment.\n\nPlease remember, my consultation should not replace advice from a physician who has thoroughly investigated your condition and obtained conclusive diagnosis."}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,I have high eye pressure of 30 and 24, visual field loss, and at times I go completely blind in both eyes. I have also gone blind in just one eye. I just went back to the eye doctor when I had the pressure of 24 and 30. I have been there three times and each time I had a high eye pressure. He at first told me everything looked good until I asked him what my pressure was again because he specifically said my pressure was good when I knew that it was high. He told me that it was fairly high when I asked for it but he says I do not have any optic nerve damage and that it is highly unlikely that I have glaucoma because I am 23 years old. But my research has told me differently that high eye pressure alone does not mean that that you have glaucoma but if you have visual field loss or optic nerve damage with your high eye pressure then you do. So I do not know what is going on? Can you please help me understand and is it possible that I do have glaucoma and should go to another doctor?", "output": "Your situation does indeed sound challenging, and it's very important to address your concerns right away. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is one risk factor for glaucoma, but it isn't the only one and it doesn't automatically mean you have glaucoma. There are actually cases of people with normal IOP who develop a form called normal-tension glaucoma.\n\nThat being said, your symptoms are concerning since they suggest there might be damage to your optic nerve or other parts of your visual system. Your repeated high eye pressures, transient blindness episodes, and reported visual field loss are worrying and need further investigation. While it's less common in younger individuals, glaucoma can occur at any age.\n\nDespite your current doctor saying your optic nerves look fine, considering your symptoms it would be prudent to seek a second opinion, preferably from an ophthalmologist specialized in glaucoma. A comprehensive glaucoma evaluation typically includes measuring intraocular pressure multiple times, evaluating drainage angles, examining optic nerve head, and performing visual field testing & optical coherence tomography (OCT) scan of optic nerve and retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL).\n\nIf diagnosed early and treated appropriately, vision loss because of glaucoma can be delayed. So, acting promptly now could protect your vision later. Stay calm and proactive."}

My pediatrician suggested Colicaid and Yamoo which I am using four times a day. Still, he gets gas and spits up. And now he did not poop for the past two days and trying very hard and cries in between feeds by trying to poop. Is this an effect of enzymes? Please help.", "output": "It sounds like you're dealing with a couple of different issues - infantile colic (evening gassiness and crying) and gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD (spit ups after feeds). These are fairly common in infants and unfortunately can cause quite a bit of discomfort.\n\n1. **Infantile colic**: Many parents find some relief using interventions such as gripe water, Simethicone drops (like Colicaid which helps to break down gas bubbles), dietary changes, and soothing techniques like swaddling, motion (rocking/swaying), white noise, etc. However, these strategies may not work for all infants. It's also important to remember that colic tends to peak around 6 weeks of age and then gradually improves over time, typically resolving by 3-4 months of age.\n\n2. **GERD**: Spit up is very common among babies and while it's sometimes tied to GERD, many otherwise healthy infants also spit up frequently ('happy spitters'). Changing feeding habits can often help manage GERD symptoms - smaller, more frequent meals; keeping the baby upright during and after feeds; and avoiding vigorous activity immediately following meals can all help. Medications can be considered if lifestyle modifications aren't helping or if your baby isn't gaining weight well.\n\nRegarding your recent concern about your baby's change in bowel movements, it's actually normal for the frequency of pooping to decrease as babies get older\u2014with breastfed babies, it's not uncommon"}

Spirometry test was normal as it was a physical exam. I am so scared that it might be a progressive disease, but I hope that it is just an old scar as it is really small. Otherwise mostly healthy with no cough or difficulty breathing at all. Are all lung scars progressive?", "output": "No, not all lung scars are progressive. If the scar you have is from an old infection or injury and it doesn't represent a disease process like IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis), it will likely stay the same size. \n\nIPF is a more serious condition that typically presents with symptoms such as shortness of breath, cough, and decline in lung function. Since you don't have these symptoms and your spirometry test was normal, it's much less likely that what was seen on your X-ray represents something like IPF.\n\nThe radiologist's recommendation to return for a comparative X-ray in six months is well advised. This would allow for any changes in the appearance of the lungs to be noted over time. However based on the findings and your symptomatology, it sounds like an old scar which should not grow or may even get smaller over time.\n\nIt's natural to feel scared when there is uncertainty concerning health issues. Continue to communicate with your healthcare provider about your fears and concerns. They're there to support you and guide you along the way.\n"}

Thanks.", "output": "These lab results indicate that you have more red blood cells (RBCs) than normal, and these cells are both smaller in size (low MCV) and have less hemoglobin (low MCH). This combination often points towards microcytic anemia. Microcytic anemia can occur due to a few reasons including iron deficiency, thalassemia, or chronic disease.\n\nYour high total RBC count could be due to various reasons such as dehydration, lung disease, kidney disease, or conditions that increase your body's erythropoietin levels stimulating more red blood cell production.\n\nOn the other side of things, your RDW-SD is on the lower side. Lower values may indicate a lack of variation in size between different RBCs. However, since your actual RBCs are also running small, this would still likely point at conditions such as thalassemia.\n\nPDW refers to the variance in platelet size which might mean possible physiological stress like infection, inflammation, malignancy, etc.\n\nOverall, while there isn't enough information to make a precise diagnosis, I recommend meeting with your doctor for further discussion. More tests may need to be ordered for accurate diagnosis.

It is not at all decreasing. Even when washing her hair, lots of hair loss is seen. I am worried about it. What could be the reason? Any remedies?", "output": "Hello, I understand your concern. A type of hair loss called Telogen Effluvium can occur a few weeks to months after a high fever or severe infection. When the body is stressed, it can push more hairs into the shedding phase. \n\nThankfully, in most cases, this type of hair loss is temporary and resolves without treatment within 6-9 months. However, for peace of mind and to rule out other causes like nutritional deficiencies, hormonal disorders, or certain medical conditions, I recommend you consult with a pediatrician or dermatologist.\n\nIn the meantime, make sure she maintains a healthy diet rich in protein sources (like eggs and dairy products), fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and Omega-3 fatty acids are beneficial for hair health. Also, avoid styling her hair too tight as that can lead to additional hair loss. Please remember not to worry excessively; stress can worsen the condition."}

The emergency contraceptive pill (like an Ipill) is quite effective when taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex. And most importantly, the urine pregnancy test was negative.\n\nThe lighter bleeding you experienced could be due to the side effect of the pill. These pills may also disturb your menstrual cycle for a month or two, causing periods to either come early, delay, or be somewhat altered in nature (lighter or heavy).\n\nAlthough I must stress that urine pregnancy tests should ideally be done early morning when the concentration of the hormone (HCG) is highest.

Burning feet is also there accompanied by gas and constipation.", "output": "Hello,\n\nIt sounds like you're experiencing a few common symptoms associated with pregnancy. However, the sudden onset of nausea at this stage and burning sensation in your feet could be indicative of something that needs medical attention.\n\nNausea can be part of normal pregnancy but it's unusual to start suddenly late in pregnancy. It could potentially indicate a liver issue such as pre-eclampsia or HELLP syndrome especially if accompanied by upper abdominal pain, severe headache, visual changes, reduced baby movement, or swelling in face/hands/legs.\n\nFrequent urination is common in pregnancy because the enlarged uterus puts pressure on the bladder. But it could also indicate a urinary tract infection, gestational diabetes, or other conditions.\n\nBurning feet can occur due to increased weight bearing during pregnancy leading to foot strain. It can also be due to compression of nerves or edema (swelling). However, sudden onset of burning sensation should be evaluated for peripheral neuropathy, often related to nutritional deficiencies, infections or metabolic disorders like diabetes.\n\nGas and constipation are common during pregnancy due to hormonal changes which relax the intestinal muscle. This results in slower digestion and gas build up. Increasing water intake, eating high-fiber foods, maintaining physical activity can help but talk to your doctor about using safe laxatives or medication for relief if symptoms persist.\n\nGiven these symptoms, I recommend you seek immediate medical attention. Your healthcare provider can examine you and may suggest urine tests, blood tests and ultrasound to rule out any complications. Meanwhile"}

It sounds like she has had a complex medical history and is dealing with multiple chronic conditions. Please understand that online advice can never replace an actual physical examination.\n\nHer inability to walk or move properly could be due to the residual effects of her stroke, or possibly worsening diabetes leading to peripheral neuropathy. Furthermore, changes in behavior could be a symptom of progressing cognitive impairment sometimes seen with aging, diabetes, BP management issues, or long term sequelae of stroke.\n\nThe most crucial part of managing her condition would be strict control of her blood sugar, blood pressure levels and the administration of anti-seizure medications without fail. Physiotherapy to help restore as much function as possible might also be beneficial, if not already being done.\n\nHowever, given the sensitive nature of her case and potential interactions between different drugs and diseases, it's impossible to suggest additional medication without a comprehensive evaluation.

How much time it will take to recover? For how many days the drain has to be installed?", "output": "Drainage of pus from your liver abscess is a part of the healing process, and indicates that your body is eliminating the infection. The color you describe could be due to the nature of the infection or blood content in the abscess. However, if the discharge changes to a fresher red blood, increases significantly in volume, or if you experience associated symptoms like fever, severe pain, nausea/vomiting, I recommend contacting your surgeon immediately.\n\nAs for recovery time, it varies depending on many factors such as your overall health status, size and location of the abscess, the presence of other medical conditions etc. Typically, it can take anywhere between a few weeks to several months. \n\nThe duration the drain stays in place is driven by how well and quickly the abscess shrinks down. Your doctor will probably order follow-up imaging studies (like an ultrasound or CT scan) to determine when the abscess has resolved enough to remove the drain. It's very individual and again, can be anywhere from days to weeks. Remember, though, safety comes first. Better to have the drain longer than necessary rather than removing it too soon.\n\nIt's very important to keep all follow up visits with your healthcare provider so they can monitor your progress accurately."}

Or would it just slow down the process of making me better? I know it is a silly question to ask, but I am half minded on it and would prefer not to end up in the hospital.", "output": "Alcohol generally isn't recommended with antibiotics or other medications. This isn't because it's \"deadly\", but alcohol can increase the side effects of these drugs, including their potential for causing drowsiness, dizziness, and upset stomach. More importantly, alcohol could impair your body's ability to fight infection and delay your recovery. Also, drinking alcohol while having conditions like asthma and bronchitis can exacerbate symptoms.\n\nFor instance, some specific antibiotics like Metronidazole, Tinidazole, etc., can cause severe reactions if taken with alcohol, leading to nausea, vomiting, rapid heart rate, etc. \n\nIn general, moderation is key. If you absolutely must have a drink, limit it and alert your health care provider beforehand.

According to your description, it seems like you may be experiencing some form of urethral stricture or other structural damage secondary to the trauma in question. It's also possible that there may be injury to local nerves which could affect ejaculatory control.\n\nComplex issues such as these are usually managed by specialized urologists who can provide a more comprehensive evaluation and treatment plan. Once imaging studies are performed (like an MRI or ultrasound), we can better understand the nature of the problem.\n\nSurgical options for urethral strictures include urethroplasty, where the affected part is removed and the healthy parts reconnected, or dilation, where the stricture is stretched open. For ejaculation problems, if medication does not work, behavioral techniques and physiotherapy involving pelvic floor exercises are considered.\n\nApart from this, depending on cause and exact issue, any potentially damaged nerves might recover with time and appropriate medication/supplementation such as nerve growth factors, but it depends heavily on individual circumstances.\n\nPlease remember this is only general advice.

And I am serious about the removal if indeed it has lower radiation risk, even though I know kidney is very important. Please suggest.", "output": "I understand your concerns regarding radiation exposure during procedures for kidney stone treatment, such as CT scans and lithotripsy. It is important to remember that these diagnostic and treatment methods are used because their benefits generally outweigh potential risks.\n\nMedical Imaging professionals are trained to use the lowest possible amount of radiation to obtain the best possible results in compliance with the ALARA Principle (As Low As Reasonably Achievable). However, repeated exposures can add up, so it's a valid concern.\n\nWhen it comes to managing recurrent stones causing hydronephrosis, there are alternatives to repetitive radiation exposure:\n\n1. Ultrasound imaging: This uses sound waves instead of ionizing radiation, and can often be used for diagnosis itself or guiding minimally invasive procedures.\n   \n2. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): While sometimes less specific for stone diseases than CT, this modality does not utilise radiation at all.\n\n3. Using medications: If the stones are small enough, medications to alter urine pH or decrease stone forming substances might help prevent recurrent stones.\n\nRemoving a kidney is a serious procedure with significant risks and long-term consequences. Losing a kidney can, over decades, put more strain on the remaining one, eventually potentially leading to impairment.

My question is, whether we can find the root cause of his ventricular fibrillation. What is the best treatment for his case?", "output": "Ventricular fibrillation is a life-threatening heart rhythm that results in rapid, erratic electrical impulses. These cause the ventricles to quiver ineffectively instead of pumping necessary blood to the body. The precise cause of ventricular fibrillation is often hard to determine. In some people it occurs with no prior heart disease or known health conditions. However, most people who experience ventricular fibrillation have an underlying heart condition like heart disease or a structural heart problem.\n\nIt's also linked with various triggers such as heart attack, scarring of heart tissue, certain genetic disorders, stimulant drugs misuse and electric shock. For your brother, if one of these isn't evident, advanced tests can be done for clarity. Gene studies especially could be helpful considering his young age at diagnosis.\n\nRegarding the treatment, patients usually have an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) implanted which it seems your brother does already have (what you are calling a pacemaker). This device monitors heartbeat and delivers electric shocks when needed to control abnormal heart rhythms, especially potentially fatal ones.\n\nAdditionally, medication therapy may be recommended to control heart rhythm, heart rate, or treat other underlying conditions contributing to ventricular fibrillation.

Last time, I had a dry socket, when I had a wisdom tooth removal, and I am scared. Please help.", "output": "As a doctor, I understand your concern. Following any tooth extraction, including ones where a bone graft is performed, it is normal for a blood clot to form which is part of the healing process. This clot is necessary to facilitate healthy tissue and bone growth. \n\nThe collagen plug that your surgeon placed actually aids this process by helping to stabilize the clot, keep the graft material in place, and encourage tissue regeneration.\n\nDry socket occurs when this blood clot becomes prematurely dislodged or dissolves, leaving the underlying bone and nerves exposed. It's what usually causes severe pain and delayed healing. However, having a dry socket with your past wisdom tooth removal does not necessarily mean you'll experience it again with this procedure.\n\nTry to avoid doing anything that might dislodge the clot \u2013 like spitting forcefully, smoking, blowing your nose forcefully, or using straws; also avoid irritating the wound area with your tongue or fingers. Stick to eating soft foods initially and gently rinse your mouth with warm salt water after meals.

Should I go get more antibiotics?", "output": "Although I can't see your wound and therefore can't make a diagnosis, it's important that you follow up with your healthcare provider. Redness can signify inflammation or infection, but it could also be part of the normal healing process. If there are other signs of an ongoing infection like increasing pain, wound drainage, warmth around the area, fever, chills, or if red streaks are coming out from the wound, then this could be serious and you should seek immediate medical attention.

Cleanse: Gently cleanse the area with warm water and a mild antibacterial soap. Avoid harsh detergents that may irritate the area further.\n\n2. Saline Rinse: After washing the area well, consider rinsing it with a saline solution. This can often help reduce inflammation and provide some relief.\n\n3. Apply topical treatment: Application of a topical antibiotic ointment (like Neosporin) can be beneficial. Just ensure you're not allergic to the components of the ointment. \n\n4. No re-piercing: Please do not attempt to put the earring or any other object back in until you consult a healthcare professional, as this could exacerbate the problem.\n\n5. Consultation: You should seek medical advice from a doctor or nurse who can assess the situation in detail and prescribe systemic antibiotics if necessary. It is especially important if the hole is getting bigger, which can possibly suggest tissue damage.\n\n6.

It's encouraging to hear that serious conditions have been ruled out by your tests so far.\n\nThe feeling of panic with increased heartbeat and dizziness could potentially indicate a panic disorder or an anxiety disorder. Moreover, stress can certainly cause physical symptoms such as tiredness and weakness, although it usually doesn't last this long without being accompanied by emotional symptoms too. \n\nGiven the duration and impact on your life, I would recommend consulting with both a psychiatrist and psychologist for a comprehensive mental health evaluation along with what you've already discussed with your primary care physician. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is often extremely helpful in cases like these.\n\nIn terms of medical management, antidepressants/anxiolytics might be useful but should be prescribed under proper psychiatric supervision.

There's no specific dietary plan that demonstrates clear and ubiquitous benefits for all people with arthritis, but the general advice is to maintain a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats.\n\nTo respond to your question about cow milk, there isn't definitive evidence suggesting it has harmful effects on arthritis. In fact, dairy products like milk, yogurt, and cheese are significant sources of necessary nutrients such as calcium and vitamin D which support bone health.\n\nHowever, some people with certain types of arthritis (like rheumatoid arthritis) might find that dairy triggers inflammation or other symptoms. I'd recommend keeping a food diary for your mother to see if any foods correlate with symptom flare-ups. If this turns out to be the case, she should discuss it with her doctor.\n\nThere are numerous foods that are considered beneficial for individuals with arthritis, mainly due to their anti-inflammatory properties:\n\n1. Fatty Fish: Rich in Omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D, both of which could be beneficial for reducing inflammation and stiffness in joints.\n2. Green Leafy Vegetables: High in antioxidants and vitamins, these help lower inflammation.\n3. Nuts & Seeds: High in Omega-3s and Vitamin E, nuts and seeds carry anti-inflammatory properties.\n4.

From the description of your symptoms, it appears that you may have irritated or strained your lower back muscles due to trauma from the fall two years ago and ongoing strain like lifting heavy objects, prolonged sitting in the same position, or long bumpy rides. This can lead to lower back pain or numbness.\n\nHowever, this cannot be definitively confirmed without a physical examination and perhaps further investigations such as an X-ray or MRI. You should also bear in mind conditions such as herniated/slipped discs, sciatica or degenerative disc disease, which could cause similar symptoms.\n\nTake care not to lift extremely heavy objects, use proper lifting technique, maintain good posture when sitting for extended periods (especially at the computer), move around regularly and do exercises that strengthen your core and back muscles. These measures can help alleviate your symptoms and prevent further injury.\n\nIt's essential that you see a healthcare provider who can examine you properly and determine if any further intervention is necessary.

In the meantime, ensure you are following good oral health practices like brushing and flossing effectively twice daily and using a mouthwash suitable for gum health.\n\nHowever, do note that these remedies will only help in maintaining oral hygiene and alleviating some symptoms but for complete and proper treatment, visit to a dentist is necessary. The dentist will evaluate your condition and might suggest deep cleaning procedures or even surgical treatments depending upon the severity of your condition. \n\nOvergrown gums can sometimes be an indication of a serious dental issue, if left untreated could lead to tooth loss or other complications.

They are usually small pieces of bone that detach during the process of tooth extraction. They are not part of the tooth itself but rather from the jawbone where the tooth was anchored. These small shards of bone can slowly work their way up through the gums after an extraction.\n\nAfter a tooth extraction, some pain and discomfort is expected. However, if it's severe or increasingly getting worse, I would recommend contacting your dentist right away as this could be indicative of complications such as dry socket or infection.\n\nIn some instances, these bony fragments may require removal by a dental professional especially when they prolong healing time or cause significant discomfort. In other cases, they might naturally work themselves out over time. Please make sure your partner follows all post-extraction care instructions such as avoiding smoking and drinking through straws, eating soft and bland foods and keeping oral hygiene optimum without disturbing the site of extraction."}

It's important to first have rest and avoid activities that cause pain and swelling.\n\nFor home management, consider the following approach:\n\n1. Rest: Avoid putting weight or pressure on your ankle.\n2. Ice: Apply ice packs to your ankle for 15\u201320 minutes every 2-3 hours during the day.\n3. Compression: Use an elastic compression bandage to reduce swelling \u2013 it should feel snug but not too tight.\n4. Elevation: Try to keep your ankle elevated higher than your heart while lying down.\n5. Non-prescriptive medication: Over-the-counter pain relievers such as aspirin or ibuprofen can help with discomfort and inflammation.\n\nWhile these self-care measures often are very effective, please get medical evaluation if symptoms continue because fractures and other serious injuries can mimic this type of problem. If you notice increased redness, warmth, worsening swelling, inability to walk on the foot, or any changes in the skin around the ankle, don't delay in seeking medical attention. Also, gradually incorporate strengthening exercises into your routine when the pain subsides to prevent future incidents. \n\nWhen returning to jogging make sure you do so gradually and consider using footwear specifically designed for running or sports.

I would like to know from a specialist about the efficacy of Vraylar for negative symptoms, especially amotivation and alogia.", "output": "Vraylar (Cariprazine) is an antipsychotic drug that has been approved by the FDA for treating the symptoms associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Studies have shown that it may reduce both positive symptoms (such as hallucinations or delusions) and negative symptoms (like lack of motivation, anhedonia, etc.) in schizophrenia. The reported effectiveness on negative symptoms might be due to the unique receptor binding profile of Vraylar as compared to other antipsychotics.\n\nIn terms of alleviating amotivation (loss of motivation) and alogia (difficulty in speech), it's important to note individual responses can vary significantly. As such, while one patient might see an improvement another might not benefit much from the same medication or could even experience side effects.\n\nRemember also that treating these conditions often involves more than just medications; psychotherapy and social interventions are also very crucial and usually combined with medications for the best results. \n\nThe decision to change your current regimen should only be made in consultation with your prescribing physician who understands your diagnosis and treatment history.

If you're reporting your triglycerides as 30 mg/dL, they are indeed lower than the average levels observed in adults. However, extremely low levels of triglycerides (below 10 mg/dL) are usually what might indicate an underlying problem.\n\nLow triglyceride levels can be due to various factors which include malnutrition, hyperthyroidism, or malabsorption conditions such as celiac disease. Low levels do not typically lead to heart strokes, brain hemorrhages, or cancer directly. Symptoms related to these conditions would require further investigation and diagnostic workup.\n\nSince you mentioned that your diet includes oily curries with bread and that you live a sedentary lifestyle, it may be beneficial for you to have a complete check-up, including thyroid function tests, complete blood count, checks for deficiencies like vitamin B12, iron, folic acid and also specific tests if there are symptoms suspecting malabsorption (like stool tests).\n\nHowever, I would highly recommend discussing this further with a healthcare provider who has access to your full medical history and who could properly evaluate your condition and suggest the right course of action.

What can I do to avoid pregnancy?", "output": "From your description, it doesn't seem like there was penetrative sex involved. If this is the case and sperm did not come in contact with your vagina, pregnancy would be virtually impossible. \n\nUnwanted 72 is an emergency contraceptive pill that reduces chances of pregnancy if taken within 72 hours after unprotected intercourse. It works by delaying ovulation and disrupting fertilization.

It's a quick procedure usually performed under local anesthesia where the doctor uses medical equipment to remove the pregnancy.\n\nAfter 16-24 weeks, other methods may be used but these procedures get more complex as the pregnancy progresses.\n\nAs for emergency contraceptive pills (morning-after pill), they are generally considered safe for most women. They work primarily by delaying or preventing ovulation, and do not cause an abortion if a woman is already pregnant. There can be side effects like nausea, vomiting, irregular periods, etc., but these are generally mild and temporary. However, it shouldn't be used as a regular form of contraception.\n\nRegarding PCOD and ayurvedic treatment"}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,Does Methamphetamine interfere with local anesthesia? My friend was told she would not have to stop Adderall before surgery. I know that is not the same, but is there anything particularly dangerous about methamphetamine and local anesthesia? What about Phentermine?", "output": "While these drugs are not identically the same, methamphetamine, amphetamines (such as Adderall), and phentermine all have similar effects on a person's cardiovascular system. They can all increase heart rate, blood pressure, and the overall workload of the heart, which inherently carries a risk for complications when undergoing surgery (even under local anesthesia).\n\nMethamphetamine use specifically can cause unpredictable reactions to anesthetic agents and heighten the risk for perioperative complications due to its significant effect on multiple body organ systems. Furthermore, sudden withdrawal from methamphetamines may lead to rebound effects and worsen outcomes.\n\nPhentermine demonstrates similar concerns as it is also a kind of stimulant but less severe than methamphetamine. However, stopping Phentermine before major surgeries like bariatric surgery is generally recommended.\n\nWhile every individual case varies greatly based on health status, drug dosage, frequency/duration of use, and specific surgical procedure, it is always important to fully disclose all medication use - including illicit substances - to your healthcare provider prior to any medical procedures for safety purpose.\n\nAnesthesia providers need thorough knowledge about patient history in order to tailor an appropriate anesthetic plan and avoid possible serious complications. In conclusion, while there might not be immediate contraindications, methamphetamine may interfere with anesthesia indirectly. The safest approach would be to share complete information with the doctor."}

It works by reducing the production of melanin which in turn helps to lighten the skin tone. It's generally safe to use, however, it may not be suitable for everyone and can cause allergic reactions in some cases. It must also be remembered that long-term usage might have unknown side effects. Moreover, it's not designed to work like regular fairness creams.\n\nThe Clinshine Cream you mentioned has mostly natural ingredients like carrot seed oil, almond oil, and oatmeal. These are usually good for skin health with minimal side effects but beneficial effects on evenness and luminosity providing your skin is not allergic to any of these compounds. \n\nHowever, remember to always test new products on a patch of skin before using it broadly to determine whether any allergic reaction occurs.\n\nAs always, the choice between organic versus synthetic skincare is personal. Both options may provide benefits to your skin health and complexion.

CMV and HSV 1 and 2 IgG positive but IgM negative. Am I an eligible person for marriage and sexual relationship?What is the treatment plan for those TORCH IgG positive results?Of note, I had unprotected oral sex twice and protected vaginal sex three times in the last two months.", "output": "Based on the information you provided:\n\n1. Yes, an HIV 1 and 2 test with a p24 antigen is generally considered conclusive after the 28-day window period. Getting a nonreactive result means you likely do not have HIV.\n\n2. A positive result for rubella IgG indicates that you've had this infection in the past and now have immunity to it, which would not affect marriage or sexual relationship. Positive results for CMV and HSV 1 and 2 IgG but negative IgM means that at some point in your life, you were exposed to these viruses and have developed immunity against them, but currently there is no active infection - again wouldn't influence eligibility for marriage or sex. It's however advisable to inform your partner about your status particularly with regards to HSV (Herpes Simplex Virus) as it can sometimes recur.\n\n3. In general, IgG positive results for TORCH tests simply signify exposure and subsequent immunity from previous infections, so there is usually no treatment necessary unless an active infection is identified through other clinical signs or tests.\n\nRegarding the oral and vaginal sex, while you generally took precautions by using protection during vaginal intercourse, unprotected oral sex still carries a small risk of STD transmission, so regular testing is recommended.

Her neutrophils are also lower than normal range (40-70%), and lymphocytes higher than normal range (20-40%), indicative of viral infection or possibly other conditions such as lymphoma, chronic illness, autoimmunity, etc. The high ESR (normal 0-22 mm/hr) suggests some ongoing inflammation in the body.\n\nIn cases of COPD exacerbations, bronchodilators and corticosteroids are often prescribed to decrease inflammation and improve symptoms. Unfortunately these medications can have side effects especially in the elderly population. If your mother continues to cough, she may need additional management for her COPD symptoms. Many times, oral steroids or inhalers will be added until symptoms resolve. A pulmonologist would be the appropriate specialist to consult if her primary care physician isn't able to manage her symptoms effectively. \n\nHer low hemoglobin may also account for some of her symptoms - fatigue, shortness of breath, lack of energy.

Please give me some advice to quickly reduce the swelling as I have an important event later today. Thank you.", "output": "I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling uncomfortable right now. Swelling of the face due to a toothache may be suggestive of an infection referred to as cellulitis, potentially from a tooth abscess. Left untreated, these infections can spread and impact other areas such as around eye. Therefore, it's crucial to treat this promptly.\n\nWhile I understand you have an event today, unfortunately significant reduction in such swellings does not usually happen rapidly. You could try continuing with cold compresses every 20 minutes for relief from any discomfort, if it's advised by your doctor.\n\nHowever, immediate and specific medical treatment is important. Over-the-counter anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen might help reduce the swelling slightly, but I highly advise against treating yourself where an infection may be present.\n\nAt this point, though, you really should see a healthcare provider as soon as possible. You will likely need antibiotics and possibly even surgical treatment depending on the severity of the condition. Infections near the eye are particularly concerning because they can become severe quickly and impact vision.

I have tried testing pregnancy strips the result was negative. I consumed Regestrone tablets for the past four days. We do not want to have a baby because of the family situation. I want to know if I am pregnant or not. If pregnant, how to start the abortion procedure?", "output": "Firstly, I want to emphasize strongly that any medical advice given here is not a substitute for direct and personalized consultation with a healthcare provider. \n\nBased on your description, since your period was delayed and you've gotten negative results from home pregnancy tests, the possibility of pregnancy is low. The delay in your period could be caused by numerous reasons such as stress, changes in weight, or hormonal imbalances.\n\nRegarding Regestrone, it\u2019s used to regulate menstrual cycles and is not an abortifacient and therefore wouldn\u2019t contribute to termination if a pregnancy did exist. Note that taking hormones without a healthcare provider's guidance can lead to side effects and other health issues.\n\nIf you're still worried about the possibility of being pregnant, you should confirm this with a blood test or ultrasonography at a medical facility under proper guidance by a gynecologist. An ultrasound scan will give clear evidence about the existence of an early-stage pregnancy.\n\nIf you are indeed pregnant and considering termination, this process would need to be done under medical supervision. Different countries have different laws regarding abortion so consider discussing this with professionals who understand the legal aspects in your country.\n\nTalking to medical personnel is absolutely necessary as attempting self-induced abortions can produce heavy bleeding, infection, incomplete abortion, sepsis, and even death.

Recovery time varies depending on the severity of your injury. \n\nFor mild injuries where the ligament is stretched but not completely torn, recovery can take approximately 2-6 weeks with appropriate rest, PT exercises, and careful return to activity.\n\nIn cases where the ligament is partially or fully torn, recovery can take a few months even upto up 3-4 months. It may be necessary to undergo physical therapy during this period to regain normal movement and strength. \n\nYou did all right by using NSAIDs for inflammation and a crepe bandage for support. But as your symptoms extended over six months, it may indicate a severe injury that would require professional supervision. I highly recommend you to consult an orthopedic specialist or physiotherapist who can evaluate your progress and guide you through the rehabilitation process.\n\nPain management, aerobic conditioning, strengthening exercises, agility and coordination training are main components in rehab program which will help in promoting healing and regain normal function of damaged ligament.\n\nSurgery could also be considered if conservative treatments such as these have failed or if the instability continues; however, surgical indications should be discussed thoroughly with an orthopedist. \n\nRemember to avoid rush during recovery.

Now addressing your questions:\n\n1. Fluid in the para-adnexal area and posterior cul-de-sac (CDS) can be a part of normal physiologic variations, particularly during menstrual cycle. However, persistent or large quantities of free fluid may sometimes suggest conditions like cyst rupture, pelvic inflammatory disease, or in rare cases malignancy.\n\n2. Ovarian follicles are natural part of a woman\u2019s ovarian function. Each month several of these grow but generally only one matures to release an egg (ovulation). Their sizes vary at different stages of development but 6mm and 15mm would generally be within normal limits.\n\n3. A \"thick septation\" refers to a wall or partition within the cyst. Thin septations are often found in benign cysts while thick ones could potentially indicate a more complex lesion although not necessarily malignant.\n\n4. Echogenic lesions refer to areas on ultrasound that reflect sound waves more which means they are denser than surrounding tissue. This could mean various things - blood clots, debris, solid tissues etc. They don\u2019t 'normally' form in simple cysts but might be present in complex cysts or endometriomas.

However, it's important to reassure you that this condition is relatively rare, especially in younger and relatively healthy individuals like yourself.\n\nMuscle twitches can occur for a wide variety of reasons, many of them completely benign or temporary. Stress and anxiety - which are quite common postpartum - high caffeine intake, fatigue, exercise, and nutrient deficiencies (such as magnesium), can all lead to muscle twitching.

Looking for your kind advice. She is feeling better now but I am afraid to continue with another four pills. Also, I have read that Yasmin can increase blood clot which can be deadly. Please advise.", "output": "While it's true that some people use regular birth control pills for emergency contraception, this isn't the recommended method, because dose and effectiveness can vary widely among different brands. Specifically, Yasmin contains drospirenone and ethinylestradiol which are not generally recommended in high doses due to potential health risks like blood clots.\n\nThe decision to stop taking the additional dose could be reasonable considering her immediate side effects (weakness and heavy breathing). While the four pills she took might have some preventative effect, they cannot guarantee pregnancy prevention like a dedicated morning-after pill (Plan B or Ella). \n\nFor future reference, using regular contraception before intercourse or FDA-approved emergency contraception within 72 hours after unprotected intercourse is more effective and safer. \n\nAlso, it is important for your fiancee to follow up with a healthcare provider soon. They may consider administering a pregnancy test if her next menstrual period delays by over one week from the expected date, considering the risk of failure of emergency contraception attempts.

And also, how long does it take a female to fall pregnant?", "output": "NorLevo, also known as a morning-after pill, is an emergency contraceptive that's designed to prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex or failure of other forms of protection. Substance use does not typically decrease the effectiveness of emergency contraception.\n\nHowever, taking illicit substances like ecstasy can sometimes lead to risky behaviors or loss of consciousness, which might result in unprotected sex without clear memory of the event. If you're asking because this may have occurred, it would be wise to get a sexually transmitted infection (STI) screening in addition to using emergency contraception. \n\nRegarding ovulation: In a typical 28-day menstrual cycle, ovulation usually occurs around day 14. Within 24 hours after ovulation, the egg can be fertilized by sperm. Sperm, however, can stay active in a woman's body for up to five days. Therefore, unprotected sex even a few days before ovulation can potentially lead to pregnancy. \n\nThe time taken to fall pregnant can vary greatly depending on several factors including the age of both partners, general health, and frequency of sexual activity.

{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,I understand how bizarre my question can sound, given the circumstances, but still, it is an urgent matter for me. I was staying in a hotel and masturbated in the bathroom (in my room). I fear that I could have obtained HIV, if some semen or blood of the previous visitor had been on the facilities (or on the soap, which was dry and in a box and was not exposed to fresh air or light) and then came in contact with my penis (or some small wounds on penis or hands, if there were some, I do not remember their presence though). Can you look at it seriously and answer (with explanation), what is the probability for me to have obtained HIV? Even small real probability frightens me. I am a virgin.", "output": "The risk of acquiring HIV in the scenario you've described is virtually nonexistent. HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is primarily transmitted through direct contact with certain bodily fluids of a person who has HIV, usually during sexual intercourse (anal or vaginal), sharing injection drug equipment or during pregnancy, birth or breastfeeding.\n\nThis virus does not survive long outside the human body and it certainly cannot reproduce outside a human host. Importantly, HIV can\u2019t survive on surfaces, so even if the previous tenant of your hotel room had left semen or blood on surfaces, you couldn't get the virus from touching these. Furthermore, dry environments and exposure to air make the survival conditions for this virus even worse.\n\nAlthough soap isn't specifically researched to kill HIV, it's believed that most normal household soaps will effectively remove the trace amounts of HIV present on skin. So using the soap wouldn't pose any risk either.\n\nEven though you mentioned being unsure about having some small wounds on penis or hands, it\u2019s important to note that HIV doesn't enter healthy body easily. Small cuts or scratches generally aren\u2019t large enough for the virus to enter the bloodstream.\n\nIn conclusion: The likelihood of contracting HIV from the situation you\u2019ve described is extremely close to zero to impossible. However, if you continue to be worried, seeing a healthcare provider to discuss effective methods of preventing HIV can give you peace of mind. Session like counseling can provide you with useful information and promote safer behaviors."}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,I have applied steroid cream (Betnovate-C) and my skin has become extremely thin and dark now. A dermatologist recommended me to try dermaroller so I want to know is it safe? And will it work? Please explain in detail as nothing has worked for me.", "output": "Hello. Prolonged use of steroid-based creams like Betnovate-C can lead to skin thinning and discoloration. Dermarolling, also known as microneedling, stimulates collagen production in the skin, which can help with a number of dermatologic conditions including improving skin thickness.\n\nIn terms of safety, microneedling is generally regarded as safe when performed by a trained professional. It's minimally invasive with low downtime. The procedure involves using a device covered with tiny, fine-point needles to create controlled micro-injuries to the skin, triggering the body\u2019s natural wound healing process and promoting collagen and elastin production. This helps rejuvenate your skin and minimize certain skin imperfections.\n\nHowever, if done improperly, microneedling has potential risks such as unnecessary pain during the procedure, infection, bruising, bleeding, scarring, and pigment problems. So it's vital you consult with a trusted, experienced dermatologist and ensure the procedure is performed under proper sterile conditions.\n\nAs for effectiveness, dermatologists typically report positive results but individual responses vary greatly. For some people, dermaroller sessions do show considerable improvement in skin texture and tone. Your skin might look slightly pink or red immediately after treatment, but this tends to go away within a day or two.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that significant improvements require patience; they'll not be seen immediately and can take several months along with multiple treatments to achieve desired results. \n\nLastly, you should stop applying steroid"}

It feels dry, itchy, and occasionally gritty on my eyes. I recently began to experience pain around my eyes on the left side. I use to work on the computer for 8 hours a day. What medicine can I use that will cure the redness?", "output": "Your symptoms could be due to digital eye strain or dry eye syndrome, which often occurs from staring at a computer screen for too long. However, it's important to have an eye examination to rule out other possible causes as well especially considering you've not found relief with Tetryzoline and the redness has increased.\n\nArtificial tears or lubricating eye drops can provide short-term relief. These can be used multiple times a day and don't require a prescription. You would also benefit from taking regular breaks from your computer and ensuring that the monitor is placed at an appropriate distance and angle. \n\nUse the 20-20-20 rule: Every 20 minutes, take a break and look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. Also, ensure the top of the computer screen is at or slightly below eye level so you do not have to open your eyes widely \u2013 which may exacerbate dryness.\n\nDespite these measures, if your symptoms persist or worsen, seek immediate medical attention. It might be necessary to initiate more aggressive treatment like prescribing topical anti-inflammatory drugs or drugs enhancing tear production.

I do not want to wear contact lenses and cannot go for LASIK because of keratoconus in my right eye. When can I get rid of this feeling or get a proper way of coping with it?", "output": "The head pressure you're feeling might be due to improperly fitted glasses. They may be too tight causing discomfort and that feeling of pressure around your head. It could also be attributed to eye strain if your prescription has changed and you haven't updated your glasses yet.\n\nYour first step should be getting an appointment with your optometrist or ophthalmologist. They can assess if the pressure is from your glasses being too tight or if your prescription needs updating.\n\nFor keratoconus, treatments often aim at slowing progression of the condition and improving vision. Glasses or soft contact lenses may help in early stages. In some cases, rigid gas permeable (RGP) contact lenses may be suggested by your doctor. Later stage treatment options include corneal cross-linking, topography-guided conductive keratoplasty, intracorneal ring segments, and corneal transplants.\n\nThere's no definitive timeline when the pressure sensation will go away as it depends on the root cause, but generally once the trigger (ill-fitted glasses or incorrect prescription) has been addressed, relief should follow soon after.\n\nConsider taking breaks every 20-30 minutes when doing close-up work like reading or using a computer to reduce any possible eye strain. Ensure good lighting during these tasks as poor light can increase strain.\n\nIn terms of coping mechanisms, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, such as ensuring enough sleep, staying hydrated, nutritious diet, physical exercise, reducing stress and avoiding excessive caffeine, can contribute to overall well"}

These tests tend to be very accurate when used correctly. Having said that, these symptoms can also be side effects of birth control pills like Lo Loestrin Fe especially if you recently began taking them or changed the type you normally use.\n\nThe bleeding you're experiencing could likely be withdrawal bleeding due to discontinuing the pill. If this bleeding or any of your other symptoms become severe, I would recommend seeing a healthcare provider as soon as possible to rule out any other potential issues unrelated to your birth control (like infection, thyroid disorder etc).\n\nIt's also advisable to visit your healthcare provider or gynecologist even if the symptoms aren't severe but continue persistently.

Also, should I be concerned about rabies? She was not symptomatic but she mentioned that she was recently from Shanghai and had a dog. I did not notice any bite marks on her and she appeared in good health but I am still worried. Is rabies a concern at all?", "output": "Though highly unlikely, there is a small risk of exposure to sexually transmitted infections (STIs) anytime you have any sort of sexual contact with another person. This includes receiving anilingus, even if no symptoms are currently visible. The bacteria and viruses that can cause STIs sometimes take a while to lead to noticeable signs or symptoms\u2014or may never cause them.\n\nIn regards to the pimple on your back\u2014yes, it's possible that bloodborne pathogens could be transmitted this way. If the masseuse had an oral infection, like herpes simplex virus, she/he could potentially transmit the virus to any open wounds or mucous membranes. However, the risk is generally pretty small, particularly given what sounds like a fairly minimal abrasion/irritation from your description. \n\nShowering after such a massage is always a good idea but not completely protective against potential infection with an STI.\n\nAs for rabies, the risk would be extremely low. Rabies is typically only spread through bites or scratches from infected animals - primarily dogs in many parts of the world\u2014in direct contact with saliva or brain/nervous system tissue. It's not spread through licking skin or various other forms of casual contact. Also, you noted she didn't exhibit any symptoms or abnormal behavior indicative of being infected with rabies which reduces the risk further. But again, the risk here seems extraordinarily low, almost negligible.\n\nIf you're feeling anxiety about potential STI exposure, consider getting tested now and then again in a few"}

A deep wound may take several weeks to months to completely heal, and in some cases, might require professional attention from a healthcare provider.\n\nHere are some basic steps that could help improve your wound's healing process:\n\n1. Proper Wound Care: Clean the wound daily with warm water and mild soap. Pat it dry gently and don't rub.\n2. Nutritional Support: Eating protein-rich foods contributes to wound healing.\n3. Adequate Hydration: Keep yourself well hydrated as it helps to keep your skin moist and enhances recovery.\n4. Avoid Stressful Activities: Don't stress the wounded area especially during the first few weeks following the procedure.\n5. Follow-Up With Surgeon: Your surgeon is best equipped to guide you regarding the condition of your scar, whether a graft would be needed, and any specialized ointments that are optimal for your specific situation.\n\nYou should contact your healthcare provider immediately if you observe signs of infection such as increased redness, warmth around the wound, pus, or if you develop a fever.\n\nThis advice presented is not a replacement for clinical examination and proper diagnostics.

I am continuing the tablet regularly at night for the last two days. Should I continue to take the tablet regularly till completion of the pack of 21? Will protection start from the first month or do we have to use extra protection like a condom? Should I start taking a fresh pack on the first day of every period?", "output": "Femilon is a combined oral contraceptive, which means it contains both estrogen and progestogen. When starting Femilon, it's advised to take the first pill on the first day of your menstruation, so you did correctly taking the tablet when you thought the period started.\n\nNow regarding current situation: considering that you've only got spotting instead of a full-on period, there might be some confusion. However, as long as you're consistently taking the drug daily around the same time, you still should get contraceptive protection. So, continue taking the tablet regularly till the completion of the pack of 21 days. Once this pack finishes, wait for seven pill-free (or placebo pill) days during which you may experience withdrawal bleeding before starting a new pack.\n\nRegarding extra protection: If Femilon is taken accurately without missing pills, then it generally offers reliable contraceptive protection after one week of regular consumption. However, to ensure maximal protection particularly during the initial few weeks, using additional methods like condoms is usually suggested. This also ensures protection against sexually transmitted diseases. \n\nIn future, start each new pack after seven pill-free days regardless of whether the bleeding has stopped or not. Every subsequent pack must be started on 'Day 8', one week after having taken the last tablet from the previous pack, even if menstrual bleeding is still going on.

There are no fibroids or polyps or other pelvic masses or free fluid. Then what is it?", "output": "Your symptoms and ultrasound findings suggest that you might have a condition called adenomyosis. Adenomyosis is a condition where the cells of the lining of the uterus (the endometrium) are present in the muscle wall of the uterus. This can cause heavy, painful periods and a 'bulky' looking uterus on ultrasound.\n\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) could also contribute to your irregular periods. PCOS is a hormonal disorder common among women of reproductive age. It causes the ovaries to have multiple small cysts and may affect menstrual cycle regularity, often causing infrequent or prolonged periods.\n\nHowever, with your increase in symptoms more recently, it's possible that the adenomyosis in your uterus has worsened. You mentioned having an anteverted uterus which is nothing abnormal; it simply refers to the direction that your uterus tilts and it\u2019s usually facing forward toward your belly button.\n\nMefenamic acid and tranexamic acid are commonly used to relieve symptoms related to heavy bleeding. However, if these medications aren't controlling your symptoms, please make sure to revisit your OB-GYN to discuss alternative management options for your adenomyosis.\n\nAdditionally it would be prudent to rule out other gynecological conditions that might co-exist or even exacerbate your current condition.

The main symptoms are usually similar to what you described: feeling an itch or a prick at the site, a mark that appears as a tiny puncture wound, possibly minor swelling, redness or heat around the bite area. \n\nHowever, determining if the creature was indeed a bat can be quite difficult without having captured it for examination. Some other insects and species (like mosquitoes) might also cause small pricks that itch.\n\nIf you suspect you've been bitten by a bat, it's essential that you seek medical attention immediately because bats are known carriers of Rabies - a sometimes fatal disease that is preventable if treated early. Even if you didn't feel anything initially, seeing small wings and landing on your neck indicates there could have been contact with a flying animal like a bat, which justifies being evaluated by a healthcare professional urgently.

That said, the symptoms you've described such as fever, cough, cold and respiratory distress align with bronchiolitis.\n\nIn terms of treatment, Asthalin (a bronchodilator) can help to open up the airways to make breathing easier, while nebulizers and oxygen support are used for serious cases to aid in breathing either due to significant bronchospasm or when the oxygen saturation falls due to disease progression.\n\nThe sudden decrease in your baby's SpO2 level and his subsequent need for oxygen support is concerning but not entirely unusual given that he has bronchiolitis. This is a condition where the small airways within the lungs become infected and swell blocking the free passage of air. The blockages also cause mucus buildup making it hard for your baby to breathe.\n\nRetraction or working harder to breathe sometimes requires supplemental oxygen until things improve, which usually takes a few days to a week. If there is still difficulty breathing even after medication, then additional support like oxygen might be needed.\n\nI would advise you to continue following the instructions provided by your child's doctor closely and keep monitoring his condition.

It has been four weeks since the incindent and I have no herpes symtomps. What are my chances of having herpes? I know people might not show symptoms. I am married and I felt very guilty for what I had done and told my wife. We are planing to have kids. What are the chances of her getting herpes and passing on to our baby? I appreciate all your help with my concerns.", "output": "Oral herpes, often caused by HSV-1 (Herpes Simplex Virus 1), can be contracted through oral sex. If the women were infected and shedding virus even without symptoms, there was a risk of transmission.\n\nHowever, given it has been four weeks since the exposure and you have not shown any symptoms like blisters or sores on your genitals, the probability you contracted HSV from that encounter is low but possible, as some individuals may never show symptoms yet still carry the virus.\n\nIt's recommended to get tested for herpes as well to give yourself peace of mind and assure safety. An IgG antibody blood test can help confirm if you're carrying the virus, although the results might not be definitive within the early weeks post-exposure. \n\nAs for your wife, if you do indeed have genital herpes and engage in unprotected sex with her, there is a risk she could contract it. This could potentially affect a future pregnancy. If your wife were to contract herpes and have an active outbreak when delivering, this poses a risk for neonatal herpes, a serious condition. However, this scenario is relatively rare, especially if precautions are taken. \n\nYour regret about your actions suggests you've learned from this event, which is important. Mistakes happen, but honesty and responsibility go a long way toward mending subsequent issues. Regardless, I would recommend reviewing your sexual health habits overall; always insist on barrier protection outside of a mutually monogamous relationship where both partners are known to be disease-free"}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,How accurate are skin prick tests for predicting positive reactions? My family is interested in a pet and I have had negative skin prick and blood work tests for dander. Before we bring a pet in and before my kids become bonded, is it reasonable to assume negative tests will translate in no reactions. Occasionally, when I interact with animals, I have a reaction but it is difficult to determine whether it is actually the pollen which I am highly allergic to.", "output": "Skin prick tests, also known as puncture or scratch tests, are often used to diagnose allergies and are considered quite accurate when it comes to detecting allergic reactions. They generally have a sensitivity of 85-90% and specificity about 70-75%.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that both skin prick tests and blood tests are not infallible\u2014they aid in the diagnosis, but they don't give absolute answers. There can be false positives (the test shows an allergy when one isn't really there) and false negatives (the test doesn't show an allergy when one is present).\n   \nIf you've had negative results for pet dander but still experience symptoms around animals, it might indeed be due to other allergens such as pollen, which you mentioned you're highly allergic to. Animals can carry outdoor allergens like grass, tree, and weed pollens on their fur.\n\nIt may be worth trying some controlled exposure to potential pets and closely monitoring your reaction before making a decision. You could spend time with the animal outside your home or even consider fostering first. Please make sure to discuss this plan with your allergist or immunologist since they\u2019re familiar with your medical history and can provide personalised advice.\n   \nUltimately, while negative tests certainly suggest lower chances of reacting, it would be unwise to assure that they guarantee no reactions at all."}

My first period after insertion was very heavy and painful, more than usual, but I heard that was likely to happen. It lasted for two and a half weeks. Since then, I have had spotting daily, some days heavier than others, but very frequent. I also have been experiencing mild cramping and bleeding after intercourse. Is this a dangerous condition?", "output": "What you're experiencing is quite common in the first few months after having an intrauterine device (IUD) inserted. The hormonal IUDs like Skyla often cause irregular bleeding and spotting, which typically decreases over time as your body adjusts to it.\n\nHowever, it's not normal if these symptoms persist for longer than a couple of months or if they become more severe. Painful sex and bleeding after intercourse is also unusual with an IUD and may indicate potential issues such as improper positioning of the IUD or an infection.\n\nGiven the prolonged duration of your symptoms, I recommend making an appointment to see your doctor for a check-up. They might want to confirm that the IUD is correctly positioned and whether there's any sign of infection or other abnormalities. If the pain during intercourse persists, further evaluation should be considered."}

Are these side effects of the contraceptive?", "output": "Bruising is not a common side effect reported with the use of Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo. Common side effects may include nausea, vomiting, headache, bloating, breast tenderness, swelling of the ankles/feet (fluid retention), or weight change.\n\nHowever, hormonal birth control pills like Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo can affect your blood's clotting mechanism, making you more susceptible to bruising or bleeding. It would be best to consult your doctor about these bruises especially if they appeared without injury, are large or painful, or are accompanied by other unusual symptoms such as fatigue, fever, or unexplained weight loss. There could also be other reasons unrelated to the contraceptive causing the bruising. Therefore, it's essential to receive a professional medical evaluation."}

I was wondering if you could help me understand the process more. Thank you.", "output": "Sure, I'd be glad to help clarify things for you.\n\nA frenectomy is a procedure performed to remove the frenulum, the piece of tissue that attaches your upper lip to your gums in between your two front teeth which sometimes can cause or maintain a gap. While this procedure can certainly assist in closing a gap between front teeth, especially if it has caused the gap, it's not always enough on its own, particularly with a significantly large gap.\n\nDental braces are used for treating and aligning the teeth and perfecting dental bite. In cases like yours where the frenum might have caused a gap, the frenectomy is commonly performed either before or during orthodontic treatment (braces) as part of a comprehensive plan to close the distance between the teeth.\n\nHowever, every case varies depending on the individual patient's oral condition and anatomy. If your dentist said that it was not necessary, they must have taken into account many factors about your specific situation. It's possible that from their evaluation, even though your gap is quite large, they anticipate that removing the problematic frenum will allow your teeth to naturally move closer together without the need for braces.\n\nIf you're worried or unsure, don't hesitate to discuss further with your dentist about why they suggest it isn't necessary in your case for follow-up orthodontics. Additionally, second opinions from other dental professionals, such as an orthodontist, could also provide you with more clarity."}

Unfortunately, recurrent boils (furuncles) can often be a sign of an underlying condition in your body or persistent bacterial colonization on your skin.\n\nAs they are caused by Staphylococcus aureus bacteria most of the time which is susceptible to Mupirocin, using Mupirocin can help reduce the chances of recurrence, apply it 3 times a day as directed.\n\nContinuing with Amoxiclav beyond prescribed period is not generally recommended without doctor's consultation, especially since it seems like you might need a different antibiotic or combination therapy if the infection is recurring. Also because prolonged use of antibiotics can lead to antibiotic resistance or other side effects. \n\nYou could take a warm compress and put it on the area for relief. It might also provide some help to bring the boil to a head and reduce discomfort. However, do not try squeezing or popping them yourself as it may worsen the infection.\n\nStaying healthy overall by maintaining good nutrition and hygiene can also help your immune system fight off these infections better.\n\nLastly, I strongly suggest that you go back to your doctor or seek a dermatologist. You might require further work-up to screen for any potential risk factors causing the frequent recurrences.

All the symptoms have started after my treatment for herpes from a hospital. Do all my symptoms say something about HIV? Previously, I was tested negative for HIV on the 27th day of exposure.", "output": "The symptoms you're experiencing might not necessarily mean that you have HIV. Symptoms of a new HIV infection are often similar to other viral illnesses such as the flu and they can include fever, rash, sore throat, muscle aches, fatigue, swelling of the lymph nodes, ulcers in the mouth or on the genitals, night sweats, etc.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that these symptoms alone cannot confirm if someone has HIV. The only way to know for sure if someone has HIV is by getting tested. It's also possible that your symptoms could be related to the recent herpes outbreak or another unrelated condition.\n\nIf you're concerned about an exposure to HIV, please get re-tested. Many HIV tests are most accurate three months after exposure, although they can sometimes detect antibodies produced in response to an HIV infection sooner. \n\nRegardless, these symptoms need to be evaluated  - consult with healthcare professionals for further assistance."}

Peripheral neuropathy is typically associated with conditions like diabetes, but it can also occur independently. It could also be due to a vitamin B12 deficiency, hypothyroidism, or even stress and anxiety.\n\nAlthough your ECG and blood reports are normal, these tests may not pinpoint specific causes of aches or tingling sensations. I would recommend consulting with a neurologist who can perform a more thorough evaluation. They may conduct electromyography (EMG) or nerve conduction studies to get a better understanding of what's causing your symptoms.\n\nIn addition, maintaining a healthy lifestyle which includes a balanced diet with sufficient vitamins and minerals plus regular exercise can help manage your symptoms. Also, try to reduce stress levels through relaxation techniques such as yoga, meditation, or deep breathing exercises."}

An ECG or Electrocardiogram needs to be interpreted by a medical professional who has specialized training in ECG interpretation. High blood pressure and low heart rate may not necessarily point towards a myocardial infarction. Symptom presence like chest pain or other factors such as risk factor status (like smoking, diabetes, high cholesterol levels, age, family history of heart diseases) should also be considered.\n\nSince you have high blood pressure and low heart rate, it's important you consult with your doctor for further evaluation, diagnosis and management.

{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,Does the keto diet positively affect and alleviate stomach issues such as IBS?", "output": "There's some evidence that the ketogenic diet can help with certain gastrointestinal issues. The ketogenic diet is a high-fat, low-carb diet that puts your body into a metabolic state called ketosis, where it uses fat, rather than carbohydrates, as its main source of energy. \n\nFor some people, particularly those with IBS-D (where diarrhea is the predominant symptom), a keto diet can help because high-fat foods slow stomach emptying which reduces diarrheal symptoms. Further, a reduction in carbohydrates might lead to less gas production, potentially helping those who suffer from bloating.\n\nHowever, everyone reacts differently, and for other individuals, particularly those with IBS-C (where constipation is the primary symptom) or mixed type IBS, this diet could potentially worsen existing symptoms due to its inherently low fiber content.\n\nAs always, it\u2019s crucial to seek personalized advice from a healthcare provider like a dietitian, nutritionist, or physician before making substantial dietary modifications.\n\nRemember, adequate hydration and physical activity for bowel motility are important considerations along with any dietary interventions for managing IBS."}

Please solve my doubt.", "output": "Though the chance is considerably lower without ejaculation, it's still technically possible to become pregnant from pre-ejaculation fluids which can contain sperm. Also, missed periods are not always indicative of pregnancy; they could be due to hormonal changes, stress, weight fluctuations, etc.\n\nTo accurately assess whether you're pregnant or not, I would suggest doing a home pregnancy test if your period is late. This is usually fairly reliable. If there is any uncertainty with the result, consult with a healthcare provider. They may perform a blood test or ultrasound for more accurate results and provide advice accordingly. \n\nApart from this, always practice safe sex to prevent unwanted pregnancies as well as sexually transmitted diseases."}

However, PTSD can also contribute to the fatigue you're experiencing.\n\nBut since you mentioned distinct fatigue, it would be prudent to discuss this with your healthcare provider as it could either be due to stressful conditions or more likely there might be some other medical issue. It\u2019s important to take into account symptoms beyond lab results alone when assessing someone\u2019s health. Further investigation may involve hormonal work up, mental health assessment, nutritional evaluation, and looking at others causes like sleep disorders, chronic fatigue syndrome etc."}

After application of a corticosteroid cream (Betamil GM) for a couple of months, the ballooning has gone completely. But, the opening is very tiny. He has not complained of any pain as yet, but I am just curious to know if I should worry. Thank you.", "output": "Based on your description, it sounds like your son might have a condition called phimosis, which is when the foreskin can't be easily retracted because the opening of the penis --staying too small or narrow. It's actually quite common and usually natural in babies and toddlers. \n\nThe fact that the ballooning during urination has been resolved with the application of a corticosteroid cream shows progress, and it's also positive that your son has not reported any pain.\n\nHowever, continue to keep an eye on his symptoms. If there are any changes such as difficulty passing urine, redness, swelling or pain, these could indicate infection or other complications and you should consult with his pediatrician immediately.\n\nRemember no attempt should be made to force the skin back for cleaning, as this may lead to trauma and subsequent scarring making the phimosis worse. \nIn persistent cases, further intervention might be necessary, such as surgery but most of the time, the foreskin usually becomes more flexible naturally over time.\nKeep having a discussion with his pediatrician regarding the need for continued topical steroid use or if any further management is required."}

The itchiness, swelling, pain and discharge are all common symptoms. However, a definitive diagnosis can only be made through a medical examination.\n\nPlease visit a healthcare professional promptly for proper evaluation and treatment. In the meanwhile, avoid scratching or rubbing your eyes, as this can make the inflammation worse and potentially spread the infection. Also, maintain good hygiene practices such as washing your hands regularly to prevent further transmission. Over-the-counter solutions like artificial tears might help soothe the itchiness and discomfort but will not combat an infection if present.

Kindly tell me why this is happening to me. Is it any side effect of the tablet I am taking or any other issue?", "output": "Dizziness or vertigo can be a symptom of hypoglycemia, which is a condition characterized by lower-than-normal blood sugar levels. Since you have recently started medicines for diabetes and your recent sugars are fairly under control, it's possible that these medications might be lowering your blood glucose level too much, causing the dizziness.\n\nQosmet and Amaryl both work to reduce your blood sugar levels. If these levels get too low, symptoms like dizziness/vertigo can emerge. However, other conditions could possibly cause dizziness such as dehydration, certain ear disorders, low blood pressure, anemia, and some heart conditions.\n\nIt's important that you discuss this with your doctor who may suggest adjusting the dosage of your medications or consider additional investigation to exclude any other potential causes. Until then, monitor your blood sugar levels regularly at home, especially when you're feeling dizzy.\n \nRemember, if you have severe dizziness or dizziness with chest pain, shortness of breath, or fainting, you should seek immediate medical attention."}

It sounds like you might have a vaginal infection such as bacterial vaginosis or perhaps something like a yeast infection, both of which can cause the problems you've described.\n\nHome remedies can only provide some relief but may not completely cure it. However, here are a few suggestions for symptom relief:\n\n1. Stay clean and dry: Wash your genital area daily and make sure it's well-dried after showers/baths.\n2. Wear cotton underwear: It helps to keep the genital area dry.\n3. Avoid irritating substances: Douches, soap, bubble bath, and lotions can irritate the vagina.\n\nNevertheless, I recommend you see a healthcare provider to get diagnosing tests done and get treated appropriately. Over-the-counter treatments exist for certain conditions like yeast infections, but they should be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional. \n\nUnprotected intercourse can lead to sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including chlamydia, gonorrhea, etc., which can also present with similar symptoms. Ignoring or incorrectly treating STIs can cause serious health problems. Therefore, it is essential to contact a healthcare provider for accurate diagnosis and treatment options. \n\nMeanwhile, abstain from sexual activity until you feel better and get properly diagnosed.

Seafood allergy is caused by an adverse reaction to proteins found in fish or shellfish, not to saltwater itself. However, if their allergy is severe enough, they should be careful about potential exposure to small fragments of sea creatures in the water which could potentially lead to allergic reactions. They should also be cautious about handling live seafood while swimming.\n\nAfter swimming, it would also be recommended that they promptly rinse off thoroughly with fresh water to help minimize post-swimming allergic reactions. \n\nIt is always advisable for such individuals to have easy access to antihistamines and an EpiPen (if prescribed by their doctor) when at the beach.\n\nRemember, everyone\u2019s sensitivity levels are different and if there is any concern, it's best to consult with an allergist before engaging in open-sea activities.

Phimosis happens when the foreskin of the penis is too tight to be pulled back over the head or glans of the penis. It can make sex uncomfortable and result in loss of control over ejaculation.\n\nFirstly, I would recommend visiting a urologist for a proper diagnosis. You may have less invasive treatment options such as stretching exercises and topical steroid creams available if the condition isn't severe. \n\nMeanwhile, there are techniques like \"start-stop\" and \"squeeze\" that could help you last longer during intercourse which might be useful for you. These involve controlling your level of arousal by stopping stimulation before getting to the point of orgasm, then continuing when the desire subsides.

Dexatob/Clotrim", "output": "Ear drops like Dexatob/Clotrim are often very effective in treating outer ear infections. However, if the infection has moved to your inner ear - beyond the eardrum - then topical ear drops may not be very effective. The eardrum acts as a barrier and prevents medications from reaching the inner ear where they would be needed to combat an infection. If you've been dealing with chronic ear infections that seem to be repeatedly coming back after stopping your medication, it's crucial that you visit an Ear Nose Throat (ENT) specialist who can perform a more detailed examination & prescribe oral antibiotics or injectables if required.\n\nPlease don\u2019t self-medicate or extend the use of medicines without consulting a healthcare professional, this could cause adverse effects or resistance.\n\nKeep in mind that symptoms of inner ear infections can also include dizziness, tinnitus (ringing in the ears), nausea or vomiting, and balance problems, so it's important to seek medical attention promptly if you experience any of these symptoms."}

But I am not an orthodontist, and for more precise decisions, it's important to meet one. \n\nHowever, generally, if the decayed tooth is too damaged for restoration like fillings or crowns, extracting the tooth might become necessary. After the extraction, braces can be applied to correct the alignment of your other teeth. But remember that every case is unique.\n\nOne common practice before getting braces is indeed removing certain teeth particularly if there's severe overcrowding.

Variations in hormone levels can cause occasional spotting and irregular bleeding.\n\n2) Pregnancy: There's a small chance of conception even if your partner did not ejaculate inside you because sperm can be present in pre-ejaculatory fluid. Spotting, especially brown spotting, can sometimes occur in early pregnancy. \n\n3) Sexually Transmitted Infections(STIs) or infections: Certain STIs (such as chlamydia or gonorrhea) or other vaginal infections might cause spotting and bleeding after intercourse.\n\n4) Trauma from sex or dryness: If sex is rough or if you are not sufficiently lubricated, it could cause minor injuries to the vagina resulting in spotting or bleeding. \n\n5) Other causes: Sometimes, benign growths like polyps or fibroids in the uterus may result in abnormal bleeding. Rarely, more serious conditions like cervical cancer may be linked with irregular bleeding.\n\nTo better understand what is happening, I would recommend going to see a healthcare provider.

I consulted my general practitioner on the fourth or fifth day who prescribed some medications. I started feeling better after the seventh day and the throat improved. But almost the next day onwards I started feeling worse again but this time it was not sore throat or a runny nose exactly, just felt the mucous inside throat all the time. Never felt feverish as such or found raised body temperature (by touching only) and experienced mild body ache here and there. Nevertheless, around 1 month after this resolved totally as said above, since yesterday I have started feeling same common cold symptoms, runny nose (not sneezing or coughing much though) with uneasiness in the palate, no raised body temperature but little feverish with mild body ache here and there.In both the aforesaid cases I had taken a Cetirizine tablet on the same day (but little later in the day) the symptoms started.

It is necessary to rule out potential underlying causes such as autoimmune diseases, bone marrow disorders or possible side effects from medications.\n\nI would recommend a follow-up with a Hematologist who can interpret these results taking your complete medical history into account, along with conducting additional tests if required. \n\nRemember, we are assuming here based on limited information, and nothing replaces an actual examination by a healthcare provider."}

It used to be at night my ear would pop and get better during the day. Now my right ear has lost hearing, I would estimate about 50% and fluctuates between 50% to 75% during the day. When it is totally silent, I think I hear this tone in my right ear. I do not have headaches and can sleep fine. I have gingivitis and bleeding gums, and no other health issues. I was wondering if my ear is infected or not. I know whatever I have is connected to my frequent flying every two months for the last five years. I always wore earplugs and never had this before but forgot the last trip. Should I take antibiotic drops? I definitely have mucus in my sinus and I am not sneezing or coughing in any major way just and not sure if I am infected or not. Would antibiotic drops help me rule out infection?", "output": "It sounds like you are experiencing a condition known as Eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD), which is common in frequent flyers. The Eustachian tubes connect your middle ear to the back of your throat, and they help regulate pressure within your ears. When these tubes become blocked, often due to congestion from a cold, sinusitis or allergies, symptoms such as ear fullness, muffled hearing, and tinnitus (ringing or buzzing in the ears) can occur.\n\nHowever, since I can't physically examine you, it would be irresponsible for me to tell you whether or not you should take antibiotics. Antibiotics could potentially help if an infection is present, but it's also possible that the issue doesn't stem from an infection at all. It\u2019s essential to visit an ENT specialist or your primary care physician who can properly diagnose the cause behind your symptoms and suggest appropriate treatment.\n\nTreatment usually begins with attempts to reduce blockage, using decongestants, nasal sprays or allergy medications. In some instances, antibiotics may be prescribed to treat potential infections. Nonetheless, it would be best for you to get checked by a healthcare professional before starting any medication."}

Another possibility is a condition called molluscum contagiosum, which is a viral skin infection that results in firm, rounded bumps. However, given the duration (one year), it's less likely to be this.\n\nIt could also be something as simple as a blocked hair follicle or sebaceous gland leading to what is commonly referred to as a whitehead. Another possibility is Fordyce spots, these are small white or yellowish bumps on the skin, typically on the edge of your lips or inside your cheeks, but they can also appear on the scrotum. These are natural oil-producing glands that are completely harmless.\n\nYou should still get this evaluated by a healthcare provider. Other than visual inspection, tests may include blood work, imaging studies, and, potentially a biopsy for more definitive diagnosis.\n\nPlease note that ignoring any kind of growth is not advisable even if it seems harmless or painless initially.

Even if your levels are normal now, your body could be having difficulty maintaining these levels without supplementation.\n\nIt's not uncommon to need ongoing vitamin D supplementation especially if you live in a location where sunlight is limited or if dietary intake of the vitamin is inadequate. You might consider taking a daily supplement as opposed to a weekly one, but this depends on many factors including patient preference, medication tolerance, lifestyle, etc.\n\nHigh uric acid levels can lead to conditions like gout, which may also lead to joint pain and discomfort. It is at the high end of the normal range (3.4 - 7 mg/dL), so it would be helpful to limit foods high in purines which could raise uric acid levels further.\n \nLastly, your calcium level is within the normal reference range (8.5-10.2 mg/dL). Hypocalcemia (low calcium) can sometimes present with muscle cramps or generalized aches but this does not seem to be the case here.\n\nThus, I suggest you consult with your healthcare provider to determine an appropriate dosage of vitamin D for maintenance, assess your dietary habits, exercise routines, any risks for gout and other underlying conditions you may have. They can devise a plan that best suits your needs and condition. Additionally, monitor your sun exposure and diet to ensure adequate natural sources of vitamin D too"}

In general population circumstances, this situation is exceptionally uncommon.\n\nRegarding testing, you've done an HIV RNA PCR test, which can detect the virus directly in your blood as early as 9-11 days after exposure. This method targets the genetic material of the virus itself, ensuring that it is not relying on your body's response (like producing antibodies) to indicate infection.\n\nThe Alere combo test you mentioned detects both antigen (part of the virus known as p24 protein) and antibodies, allowing early and later detection. It's a fourth-generation test which makes it very reliable even before three months have passed since the suspected exposure.\n\nGiven the extensive testing you've done and the time that has passed, staying negative until now with these types of testing methods, it is extremely unlikely that you are infected with HIV if all exposures ceased more than 20 months ago.\n\nHowever, remember that these tests are not 100% perfect--no medical test is.

I have some tips that you might try out:\n\n1. Desensitization: Brush your tongue every day. At first, keep close to the front of your mouth, but slowly work your way back as far as you comfortably can over time. Gently stimulating the area that usually triggers your gag reflex may help desensitize it.\n\n2. Distraction techniques: Try to distract yourself by humming a tune during your dental appointments. It's hard to gag when you're humming. \n\n3. Acupressure: Squeeze your left thumb inside a clenched fist. This pressure point is linked with suppression of the gag reflex.\n\n4. Salty taste: Dropping a pinch of salt on your tongue can also curb your gag reflex.\n\n5. Breathing exercises: Most people hold their breath, which makes the body more likely to trigger a gag reflex. Instead, focus on breathing deeply through your nose to calm your gag reflex.\n\n6. Progressive relaxation: Prior to and during your dentist appointment, you might want to try progressive muscle relaxation. Tighten and then relaxed each muscle group in your body, starting from your toes and working up to your head.\n\nRemember to talk to your dentist about your concern.

We checked home pregnancy kit and it was negative. What could be the reason for delayed menses?", "output": "The hormonal imbalance caused by taking emergency contraceptives like the I-pill can disrupt your wife's regular menstrual cycle. The pills contain a high dose of hormones that prevent pregnancy, but these hormones can cause side effects like irregular bleeding and delayed periods. It isn't unusual for there to be some change in her cycle after taking such pills.\n\nThe bleed you have mentioned could be due to the effect of the pill and not an actual period. Stress and changes in lifestyle or diet can also affect the timing of periods.\n\nThe negative pregnancy test likely indicates that she is not pregnant if it was taken at the appropriate time (at least 1 week after the missed period). \n\nHowever, please remember that repeated use of emergency contraceptive pills should be avoided as they can cause significant hormonal disruptions. Regular methods of contraception are much better for routine use.\n\nIf her periods continue to be irregular or other symptoms appear, it would be advisable to consult a gynecologist for further evaluation as physical examination and investigations will give a more accurate diagnosis."}

So., I am worried about pregnancy. Any chance there is pregnancy?", "output": "The symptoms you are experiencing (nausea, vomiting, chills with fever, and weakness) are more likely to be related to side effects from the I-Pill, and potentially the stress of this situation. These symptoms are not typically signs of early pregnancy.\n\nThe bleeding you noticed could be due to first time intercourse, which can sometimes cause a small amount of bleeding or spotting.\n\nPlease also know that if you had intercourse on the seventh day of your period, this is generally considered a less fertile time in your menstrual cycle since ovulation usually occurs around mid-cycle. \n\nEmergency contraceptive pills like the I-Pill work primarily by preventing or delaying ovulation, so it should lower your risk of becoming pregnant if used correctly. \n\nHowever, no contraception method is 100% effective. If you're worried about being pregnant, take a home pregnancy test after waiting for your predicted next period date. And remember, using regular contraception such as condoms or oral contraceptives pill may provide better protection against unwanted pregnancies than emergency contraception. \n\nAnd finally, the combination of fever, chills, and weakness suggest that you might be suffering from an unrelated illness or infection.

Acyclovir (Zovirax), famciclovir (Famvir), and valacyclovir (Valtrex) are commonly used medicines. These drugs can speed up healing and reduce the severity of pain and itching associated with an outbreak. Also, they can help prevent future outbreaks.\n\nThat being said, it's crucial that you discuss your symptoms and the results of your tests with a healthcare provider in person. This is important because appropriate treatment should also take into account other factors beyond just the test result, such as any other symptoms, your overall health, potential side effects of medication, etc.\n\nLastly, remember that while these treatments can manage herpes outbreaks, there is no cure for herpes and condoms/protected sex are the best way to prevent transmission."}

Edging is a sexual technique that involves maintaining a high level of sexual arousal for an extended period without reaching climax. The goal of edging is to extend the amount of time in which you're enjoying sexual pleasure. Some people use this method to achieve stronger orgasms or enhance intimate experiences with their partners.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to bear in mind that while some people find this practice enjoyable and beneficial, others may not like delaying orgasm or might find that it creates unwanted frustration.

{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,Since a long time now, my voice sounds blocked all the time, even when I do not have the flu. Recently, I visited the doctor, and he told me that I need to take my adenoids out after three months. But, I was wondering whether there is a 100 % chance that my voice will sound perfectly normal, post the surgery or is there a chance it will not work?", "output": "As a doctor, I can tell you that adenoidectomy, or the removal of the adenoids, is often performed in response to chronic obstruction and infection issues, including persistent nasal congestion and blocked voice. The surgical procedure can definitely help improve these symptoms.\n\nHowever, it's essential to understand that each patient reacts differently to surgery. While most patients see considerable improvements in their symptoms post-surgery, there are possibilities where desired results might not be fully achieved due to individual healing processes and body reactions. There is no guarantee that your voice will sound 'perfectly' normal as this really depends on the original cause of the abnormality in your voice.\n\nAfter the recovery period from an adenoidectomy, some patients notice changes in their speech, such as sounding less nasal (since blockage is now removed), but again the degree of change varies among individuals. You may benefit from seeing a Speech Therapist after surgery if the issue persists. It's important to discuss your concerns freely with your Ear Nose Throat specialist before making any decisions."}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,Is coconut oil bad for the skin? A few years ago coconut oil was all the rage. We were told to slather it from head to toe for miraculous benefits. However, lately, it is been getting some backlash thanks to its comedogenic properties. My questions are, What are the pros of using products that contain coconut oil on your skin? What are some potential cons? What skin types can benefit most from coconut oil? What skin types should stay away from it? How do you recommend using coconut oil in one\\s routine to reap benefits and avoid breakouts? If someone wants to use natural coconut oil on their face, what kind do you recommend using (i.e. unrefined, organic, etc.)?", "output": "Coconut oil has numerous benefits and potential drawbacks when used on the skin, and its effects can vary based on individual skin types. \n\nPros:\n1. It has natural moisturizing properties: Coconut oil is a great emollient if your skin happens to be very dry. \n2. It contains antimicrobial properties: It also helps to strengthen the skin barrier which increases the anti-bacterial function of the skin. This might potentially help protect against certain infections.\n3. Vitamins and Antioxidants content: Coconut oil has Vitamin E and antioxidants that are good for your skin.\n\nCons:\n1. Comedogenic: As you mentioned, one primary concern with coconut oil is that it's comedogenic, meaning it can clog pores. This can contribute to acne breakouts.\n2. Potential Allergies: Some people may develop allergies or adverse reactions to coconut oil.\n3. Can feel heavy: Due to its thick consistency, it can feel greasy and uncomfortable on the skin especially in summers or humid climates.\n\nSkin Types:\n- Benefits most: People with extremely dry skin may benefit from the moisturizing effect of coconut oil.\n- Should stay away: Generally, anyone with oily and acne-prone skin should avoid using coconut oil as it could clog their pores and exacerbate acne problems.\n\nUsage Recommendations:\nIf you want to incorporate coconut oil into your routine without risking breakouts, consider using it occasionally rather than daily. Also, it would be better to use it as body oil rather than"}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,I noticed a small triangular bald spot in my beard three weeks ago. It was likely alopecia areata. Saw my dermatologist last week, she said it was likely folliculitis. I have had folliculitis before in the same area and it was much different. She is the doctor. So I accepted and moved on. One small spot that has some hair growing back, small thin white hair. Yesterday, I noticed what appeared to be a bald spot in my pubic hair above the penis. When I trimmed the hair back, it revealed a quarter sized bald spot and a smaller dime sized spot. I am not sure how long they may have been there as they were somewhat masked by a longer pubic hair. So, now I have what I believe to be three spots, two below abdomen and one on beard. My concern is more of them spreading than the current spots.I am now thinking back about the annual checkup that I had with my GP six months back. I advised him that in the past year the amount of semen I produce has gone down drastically. I thought it may be a testosterone issue. He advised it was likely a result of my vasectomy the year before. Also as a part of my visit, my WBC was lower than normal, outside of the range by a couple. He was not concerned about that either.My question is whether any of these things are related: decrease in semen, low WBC, and alopecia in pubic area or all separate issues? I see no reason to go back to the dermatologist as my new spots are hidden. Based on these separate facts, is there any likelihood they are related and is there any reason to see a doctor?", "output": "While your symptoms may appear diverse and separate, it's entirely possible that there could be a common underlying cause for the decrease in semen volume, low white blood cell count, and skin loss or alopecia in different body areas.\n\nLow semen volume is common after a vasectomy. However, this change varies greatly depending on individuals; some might notice a slight reduction, while others observe no noticeable difference at all.\n\nPhysical stressors and certain diseases can temporarily drop your White Blood Cells (WBC) counts slightly below the normal range. However, consistently low WBCs can signify more serious issues such as bone marrow problems or an immune deficiency.\n\nAlopecia areata, which you suspect to be causing the bald spots, is an autoimmune condition where the immune system targets hair follicles believing them to be foreign. The manifestation of alopecia isn\u2019t restricted to the head only but can occur in any part of the body with active hair growth, including pubic area and beard.\n\nThe connection between alopecia areata and low WBC can link back to the immune system - though this is not a sure-shot correlation.\n\nIt is important for you to discuss these concerns with your doctor because these symptoms although seemingly unrelated could possibly indicate a systemic issue, particularly if they continue. Your doctor may run additional tests to rule out any serious conditions.\n\nYour dermatologist should also stay updated about new spots of alopecia, even if hidden, as this pattern of hair loss helps in making a correct diagnosis and guide effective treatment.\n\n"}

That is showing negative. Please suggest what my next step should be?", "output": "From the information you've provided, it seems that your PCR test for HIV RNA yielded inconclusive results (being detected below, within and above the linear range of the assay). Meanwhile, the Western Blot test came out negative, which typically would indicate no presence of HIV.\n\nOften, when there's a discrepancy or uncertainty in test results, further testing is needed. Therefore, consult with your primary care physician or infectious disease specialist who can suggest an appropriate course of action based on your medical history and current health circumstances. They might recommend repeat testing or using a different diagnostic tool to clarify any ambiguity.\n\nIt's also highly important to take preventive measures such as practicing safe sex techniques until you are sure about your status.

I was given a breathing treatment, inhaler, and antibiotics. I started feeling a little better, then it came back in winter. I have felt poorly since then, but not this bad.", "output": "Your symptoms could be indicative of a few different conditions - some related to chronic inflammation such as Crohn's disease, and others to respiratory illness. The pain on deep breathing combined with shortness of breath may point to a respiratory issue like pneumonia or pleurisy.\n\nIn your case, given your past history of bronchitis, these symptoms could be the recurrence of another bout of bronchitis, particularly noting you've been feeling unwell since winter. Bronchitis could potentially cause all the symptoms you're describing including fatigue, body aches, headache, postnasal drip, sore throat and especially deep-breathing-related back pain.\n\nHowever, due to the complexity of your overall medical condition, it would be essential for you to consult with your doctor who could examine you physically, discuss your full medical history, and probably order tests such as a chest X-Ray, blood tests etc. In the meanwhile, drink plenty of fluids, rest, and monitor your symptoms carefully. If you develop alarming symptoms like high fever, severe difficulty in breathing, chest pain, confusion, or persistent vomiting among other things, please seek immediate emergency medical attention.

I never had white poop in such lengths. My scan reports were normal a month ago. Is there any problem to worry? Is there any threat to the baby? Should I visit the doctor urgently? Please help.", "output": "Changes in stool color can be quite normal during pregnancy due to changes in diet or from taking prenatal vitamins. That being said, white or pale-colored stools could potentially signal an issue with your liver, gallbladder, or bile ducts. It's not necessarily urgent if you are otherwise feeling well, but it would be advisable to schedule a non-emergency appointment with your health care provider to discuss this symptom and possibly have some tests run just to make sure everything is ok.\n\nThis condition doesn't directly affect the baby as the maternal and fetal systems are largely separate; however, any significant illness in a pregnant woman needs to be addressed promptly for the overall wellness of both mother and fetus. Seek medical attention sooner if you develop other symptoms like pain, fever, jaundice (yellowing skin), or persistent vomiting. But based solely on what you've written, this sounds like something that should be looked into further, but is not immediately alarming. Make sure you stay hydrated and maintain a balanced diet."}

But when I go to the toilet, I do not have the urge to pee. Is this due to UTI or STD?", "output": "Your symptoms of frequent urination and sharp pain when peeing could hint at a urinary tract infection (UTI). It could also be due to bladder irritants, stress, or potentially an STD. However, considering your age, a UTI is more probable than an STD, especially if you are not sexually active. To confirm the diagnosis and start treatment, contact a healthcare professional who can do appropriate tests. If it is an UTI, they can prescribe antibiotics to treat it. Drink lots of water in meantime to help flush bacteria out of the urinary tract and alleviate some symptoms. But remember, this advice is based on your description and should not replace a visit to your doctor's office."}

During meeting while sitting in a small quiet room, I feel very stressed and wanted to break everything and run out. Please help me overcome this.", "output": "I'm sorry to hear that you're dealing with such distressing symptoms. First, I want to clarify that it's completely normal for your stomach to make noises due to the movement of food, liquids, digestive juices, and air through your intestines. However, excessive or loud noises might be a symptom of gastrointestinal issues like irritable bowel syndrome or other conditions.\n\nMore importantly, the stress and anxiety associated with anticipation of these noises is adversely affecting your professional and personal life. Therapy, especially cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), can be highly effective in managing such anticipatory anxieties. CBT teaches effective strategies on how to respond to situations that cause fear or worry.\n\nFrom a medical perspective, first rule out any organic causes. You should consult with a gastroenterologist to evaluate if there's an underlying gut-condition causing excessive noises. \n\nSecondly, consider seeing a psychiatrist or psychologist. We need to treat both the physical symptoms and the mental stress that they are causing. Also, practicing mindfulness, relaxation techniques and maintaining a regular eating schedule can help manage symptoms. If necessary, medication may be prescribed to reduce the activity in your gut and give you some relief.\n\nAgain, don't hesitate to seek professionals' help - this combination of psychological assistance and potential medical intervention can significantly help you overcome and manage your situation.\n"}

More details about the presenting complaint: I have been bleeding nonstop for months, even while on Progesterone. And have heavy discharge with a bad smell. I went to the doctor to test for infection. Current medications include Progesterone and the past medications of the same issue include birth controls.", "output": "Pain during a swab test or vaginal examination could potentially be due to an underlying infection (like bacterial vaginosis, yeast infections, or sexually transmitted infections), which can cause inflammation and sensitivity in the area. Another possible explanation is cervicitis - inflammation of the cervix.\n\nHowever, with your symptoms of continuous bleeding even while on Progesterone, heavy discharge with a bad smell, there might be other potential causes too. It could be suggestive of an underlying gynecological condition such as endometriosis, fibroids, polyps, PID (Pelvic Inflammatory Disease) etc., which may lead to discomfort or pain during a swab test. \n\nPersisting abnormal bleeding calls for further investigations like ultrasound scans/biopsies beyond swab tests. \n\nKindly follow-up with your health care provider/gynaecologist for proper evaluation. Antimicrobial therapy, hormonal adjustment or even surgical interventions might be needed depending upon the diagnosis. Don't ignore the symptoms; early diagnosis and prompt treatment will prevent complications."}

My sperm came out but my penis was covered with a double layered condom. Now, I am suffering from fever and cough.", "output": "These symptoms could be related to a variety of different illnesses, but they are not typically signs of a sexually transmitted infection, especially if you used protection such as a condom. They're more likely due to common respiratory conditions like the flu or cold.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that condoms can't provide 100% protection against all STDs, so anytime you have sexual contact, there's some level of risk. Generally, STD symptoms can take several days or even weeks after exposure to appear, and might include unusual discharge from the penis, pain during urination, rashes around the genital areas, among other symptoms.\n\nIn your case, since you are experiencing fever and cough, it would be advisable to see a doctor for a proper diagnosis. This may be related to a regular infection or illness unrelated to the encounter you mentioned, especially in times like these where COVID-19 is prevalent."}

Can you please tell me any tablet that I can use in the meantime.", "output": "While it's hard for me to make an accurate diagnosis without a physical examination, your symptoms might be due to tooth decay, abscessed tooth, gum infection or tooth grinding. Over-the-counter pain medication like ibuprofen can provide temporary relief. Also, try rinsing with warm salt water to alleviate some discomfort.\n\nRemember, this is not a definitive treatment and is only meant as temporary relief. Once the dental offices reopen, please immediately consult with a dentist. In the meantime, maintain good oral hygiene by brushing twice daily and flossing once daily.\n  \nAs an AI, I would strongly advise never to self-medicate without first discussing it with your healthcare provider because they will know your conditions and contraindications better. \n\nAlso note it's important to reach out to healthcare professionals by telephone or online consultations during lockdown periods."}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,I am pretty sure that I have retrograde ejaculation because when I ejaculate it does not come out at the same moment of ejaculation, but it does come out seconds later and when I urinate there is some sperm. I also have male Incontinence and bedwetting problem since I was young and I am now 24 years old and a couple of times this year I found it hard to urinate, I felt like my bladder was numbed or something. So I went to a urologist and I had my testicles tested because I had pain there and thought it was the reason for all this. He gave me antibiotics I also did an ultrasound on my testicles and to check my kidney stones but everything was fine and after the antibiotics nothing change but the testicular pain.My urologist said he wants to do a TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate) but I do not know anything about the operation and he told me I will feel pain and I am scared of that but I also do not know why he wants to do this operation. I searched online and it says mercury retrograde might be from multiple sclerosis, week bladder muscle, problem with the nerves, a previous operation (does not apply to me) or medication side effect (does not apply to me).So I am not sure what to do? I want to check for multiple sclerosis and also look at my bladder muscles? Could it be a problem in the prostate? And is TURP necessary? I want a urologist who really wants to find out what is with me instead of just doing a test and not listening to what I am saying and then tell me to come back a month later. I have more than one problem and I want to know what is causing all this?", "output": "Firstly, I understand your frustration and concerns. It's important to recognize that retrograde ejaculation can be due to a wide variety of reasons including certain medications, nerve or muscle issues, or even surgeries affecting the area around the prostate. Multiple sclerosis could cause symptoms similar to yours but it would also have other symptoms which you did not mention. \n\nGiven the incontinence and delayed ejaculation, it sounds as if there may definitely be an issue with your bladder and/or the muscles/nerves controlling urination and ejaculation. Prostate problems are another possibility, particularly if you've had difficulty urinating.\n\nTURP is usually done for men who have an enlarged prostate which obstructs urinary flow. It is aimed at relieving these symptoms. If your urologist has suggested this procedure, it means he suspects your prostate might be causing some of your symptoms. \n\nHowever, considering your age (24 years old), prostate enlargement is rare - it typically affects older men. Therefore, requesting a second opinion from another urologist before proceeding to surgery could be beneficial. This gives you the chance to explore non-surgical approaches such as medication, lifestyle changes, pelvic floor exercises, or neurological studies. Moreover, you should discuss your doctor's reasoning for suggesting TURP and weigh its potential benefits versus risks.\n\nDo explore testing for neurological conditions like multiple sclerosis with a neurologist. Also consider seeking help from a specialist dealing with bedwetting and incontinence, often a urogynecologist"}

I had protected sex but I saw some blood on the inner parts of my partner. And also at the time I was having two pimples on my penis at the end and not on the tip. I am concern about that. Is an HIV test on 26th day conclusive?", "output": "The HIV CMIA (Chemiluminescent Microparticle Immunoassay) test, also known as the 4th generation test, tends to be very accurate. It is designed to detect both the HIV antibodies as well as the p24 antigen which normally appears in the body around 2 weeks after infection.\n\nWhile this makes it one of the fastest and most accurate HIV tests available, a negative result at 26 days post-exposure cannot be considered completely conclusive. This is because the 'window period' for most types of HIV testing including the 4th generation immunoassay test can extend up to 3 months from the time of exposure.\n\nHaving pimples on your penis does not necessarily increase your risk of HIV transmission unless they were open sores or lesions during your encounter.\n\nNevertheless, if you are anxious about this situation, or due to the presence of blood during intercourse, it would be advised that you take another test around 3 months post-exposure to have a conclusive result. And meanwhile, continue to engage in protected sex. \n\nRemember, using condoms consistently and correctly is the best way to prevent sexually transmitted infections. \n\nAlways reach out to a healthcare professional or counseling service center if you're feeling worried or anxious.\n"}

So, the next day I started a new medicine and took it for a few days. The blood stopped, but I felt pain, so I went back to the ER. They told me my UTI was gone and to stop taking the medicine. A few days later, I saw blood when I wiped after peeing, but it looks like it was in my discharge. It went on a few times, and I went back to the ER three days ago and said that I was peeing blood again. So, I am worried. I have not gotten my period this month, and no, I am not pregnant. I am a virgin. They said it was not a UTI and I was fine. I have had no pain or anything. Just now I peed and when I wiped there was blood in my discharge. It is not a lot but still freaks me out. I cannot tell if it is my period or something else. I have never had this happen before. My mother said that it is spotting but makes no sense to me.", "output": "From the symptoms described, it seems like you are experiencing spotting, which refers to light vaginal bleeding between periods. In some women, especially adolescents and those in their early twenties, breakthrough bleeding or spotting can occur. Hormonal fluctuations around puberty often leads to irregularities of the menstrual cycle.\n\nBut since the symptom involves blood and seems to be happening for a while now, along with the recent history of UTI, it is better not to dismiss it lightly. Although most causes of bleeding outside of menstruation are benign, it's crucial to rule out certain conditions.\n\nI would recommend getting an examination by a gynaecologist for a detailed inspection of the vulva, vagina, cervix, uterus, ovaries, and pelvis. It also might be helpful to take down notes on when exactly these episodes happen, how long they last, any other associated symptoms (pain, burning sensation etc.) if there are any. This information could be helpful during your consultation.\n\nYou did absolutely the right thing by seeking medical attention when this occurred previously - continue doing so until you have a satisfactory explanation for what\u2019s going on or the symptoms stop occurring."}

Even without sweets or acidic drinks, plaque can develop from the natural bacteria in your mouth reacting with food residuals. To control it:\n\n1. Brush two times a day: Right after waking up and before going to bed, aim for 2-3 minutes each time, ensuring you brush every tooth surface.\n2. Use fluoride toothpaste: Fluoride helps combat tooth decay by fighting germs that can lead to cavities. It also provides a protective barrier for your teeth.\n3. Floss daily: This clear hard-to-reach areas of your teeth where plaque may be hiding.\n4. Use a mouthwash: An antimicrobial mouthwash can help reduce bacteria that cause plaque and gum disease.\n\nVisit your dentist every 6 months for regular check-ups and cleanings even if you're regularly following these practices at home. If this condition continues, please revisit your dentist; there could potentially be an underlying systemic condition contributing to rapid tartar formation.

Just in case if it does not grow back by then, what should I do or wear to protect it?", "output": "You're experiencing common reactions seen after nail trauma and the subsequent removal of the nail plate. After a toenail injury, it's normal for nails to grow slower and often in a \"different\" or unfamiliar direction - which may lead to an outwards growth you described.\n\nHere's what I recommend:\n\n1. It'd be best to follow your physician's advice. If they'd suggested another review once the nail fully grows back, it could be to assess whether it's growing healthily and if any additional treatment is needed.\n\n2. The hollow gap between the nail and the nail bed may close as the nail continues to grow out. It's usually due to the way your new nail is growing after the injury. However, be aware of signs of infections like increased redness, warmth, swelling or pain. \n\n3. Do not cut the nail yourself unless you're trained to do so. Incorrect cutting can lead to further complications, including ingrown toenails and infection.\n\n4. To protect your toe during the hiking and horse riding camp:\n   - Consider wearing protective toe caps or silicone toe sleeves; these cover and cushion your entire toe, providing protection and encouraging healing.\n   - Choose footwear that delivers sufficient space for the toes to avoid direct pressure on your injured nail. Hiking boots tend be rigid and may place undue pressure on your toes if fitted incorrectly.\n  \n5. Monitor your symptoms. If the condition worsens, make sure to seek immediate medical attention.

This could potentially be why you're seeing a delay right now. Alternatively, stress over the possibility of being pregnant can also cause your period to be delayed.\n\nThirdly, having intercourse on the 24th day of a typical menstruation cycle generally would not be during your most fertile window, which makes the likelihood of pregnancy lower.

Do you see signs of ischemia, what could be wrong based on these readings?", "output": "This patient has a few clinical features that could indicate a number of possible issues. The electrocardiogram (EKG) findings together with the physical features and symptoms might suggest a cardiac problem.\n\nHigh QRS voltage could potentially represent left ventricular hypertrophy, which is commonly seen in people with hypertension. It can also be seen in athletic individuals without any pathological conditions. \n\nThe abnormal T wave and QTc interval raise concerns for potential underlying heart disease. These changes could be indicative of ischemic heart disease, but other factors would need to be considered, such as electrolyte abnormalities (for example, hypokalemia), medications the patient is taking, and other medical history.\n\nMarfan syndrome increases the risk of aortic dissection and mitral valve prolapse, which too can manifest with similar symptoms including chest tightness, palpitations, fatigue. The inverted sternum (pectus excavatum) could exert pressure on the heart and lungs potentially affecting their functions, although this effect is usually mild unless the deformity is severe.\n \nOf note, patients with Marfan's syndrome have various skeletal, eye, skin, nervous system, lung, and vascular complications. They are at higher risk for having an enlarged or dilated aorta which can lead to serious heart problems.\n\nSo based on these readings alone and without performance of further diagnostic studies, definitive diagnosis cannot be made. Consequently it would be important to get full evaluation with echocardiography, maybe stress testing to better evaluate these EKG"}

Nuchal translucency at 12 weeks and 6 days seems normal because generally a measurement of 2.5mm-3mm or more could indicate a higher risk for genetic abnormalities.\n\n2. The hCG and PAPP-A values alone cannot suggest much without their multiple of median (MoM) as these levels can vary greatly between pregnancies.\n\n3. Nasal bone being seen is a positive factor.

I have never spotted ever before.Also, I started taking Vitex at the beginning of this cycle in hopes of shortening my cycle a bit.Thank you in advance for any advice.", "output": "Some potential causes of spotting mid-cycle could be hormonal fluctuations, a variant of normal ovulation (some women spot at ovulation due to the drop in estrogen), or possibly conditions like polyps, infections, lesions on the cervix, etc. It may also be possible that Vitex, which is known to affect hormones, might be influencing your cycle.\n\nIt's hard to say definitively from a single episode; pattern over time gives better clues. If you've only just started spotting this cycle, it would be reasonable to monitor for a bit before getting too concerned. \n\nHowever, if this becomes a consistent pattern, I suggest visiting a doctor/Gynecologist. They can perform an ultrasound and possibly check your hormone levels to get a better idea of what's going on. Also, keep in mind that cycles can take some time to regulate after stopping birth control pills. \n\nRegarding trying to conceive, having irregular periods or changes in your cycle doesn't necessarily mean you won't conceive. The most important factor is ovulation, not the length of your cycle. Consider using ovulation predictor kits if you haven't already, these could bring more clarity on your ovulation period.

Further surgical intervention is typically considered once healing from the initial trauma has taken place. You might need a repair surgery for your bladder or ureter, which would be done by a specialist such as an urologist.\n\nYour doctor will determine the best course of action based on several factors, including your age, overall health, the severity of your symptoms, and the nature of your injury.

I think I may have a crack or some type of nerve ending there and it is really bothering me.", "output": "It sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of a cracked tooth, or possibly an issue with the filling not being seated properly. Pain when biting down, or sensitivity to temperature could actually be signs of a cracked tooth. Also, it is possible that despite not seeing a visible crack under examination, there still might be one at a microscopic level and this can lead to discomfort.\n\nThere's also possibility that the pain you're feeling isn't directly associated with your molar but due to gum inflammation, sinus issues, or a problem with an adjacent tooth - these are common causes of referred dental pain. However, only a thorough clinical examination can confirm these.\n\nIn terms of the \"flap\" feeling on your top tooth, it appears unusual. It could be due to gum issues or it might be related to healing if your filling was near the gum line. \n\nMy advice would be to consult with another dentist for a second opinion if your current dentist couldn't find any cause for the symptoms. They can use other diagnostic tools like higher resolution x-rays to try to pin down the source of your discomfort. If the problem still persists after all reasonable dental sources have been ruled out, consider connecting with a doctor because sometimes problems from other areas (like sinuses) can present as toothache."}

They are often influenced by genetics, as in your case where your mother and grandmother also have many moles. Sun exposure also plays a significant role in mole formation.\n\nTo help prevent new moles or changes to current ones:\n\n1. Limit Sun Exposure: UV light can play a big role in the development of moles. Always apply sunscreen when going out, wear protective clothing such as hats, sunglasses and long-sleeved shirts, and try to stay in the shade during peak sunlight hours.\n   \n2. Regular Check-ups: Given you have a family history of moles, it may be beneficial to see a dermatologist for regular skin checks. They can monitor changes and spot any signs of concerning moles early.\n\nLDermatologist can help remove those that bother you for cosmetic reasons. Some methods include surgical removal or laser treatment depending on the size and location. However, removal doesn't prevent new ones from forming.\n\nRemember, if you notice a change in size, color, shape, or a new symptom such as bleeding or itching in any of your moles, I advise you to go to a doctor or dermatologist as soon as possible for an evaluation.

For the past two to three days, the urgency kind of feels to be getting worse, I feel as if I will not be able to hold it. However, I am still able to as there is no leaking. There is no burning or irritation or any discharge. No recent sexual encounters and no other associated symptoms. I take Coveram 10/10 for essential hypertension and Valdoxan 25 because I also do suffer from anxiety. I have been under stress lately as I was doing my exams this past week and finished today. I have done a few tests at my family doctor: Last week I did a dipstick which was normal apart from +1 protein. Voiding bladder US was normal (450 mL pre voiding, 45 mL post voiding). An initial urine culture was normal according to my doctor. Yesterday, I performed another dipstick and urine culture. The dipstick was normal, and early urine microscopy showed 10 to 100 white cell count. We are waiting for the cultures to return. Due to the result of the white cell count, my doctor said it would be worth a try to undergo a 5-day course of antibiotics (Keflex).Today is my third day of antibiotic treatment, symptoms are largely the same. Today, I attempted to hold my bladder. It felt fine in the morning but as the day went on, my symptoms returned and I am finding it harder to hold my bladder. Also, for the first time, I tried going for a run. The entire time I felt a heaviness in my bladder and felt a strong urge to urinate, even though I went before my run began. What do you think could be going on? My doctor believes that it is either a UTI, or most likely, a hypersensitive bladder due to exam stress. However, there have been days where I have not felt stress at all yet symptoms have continued. I am really worried as I want to go back to work in five days and I do not think I will be able to manage the way things are at the moment. My family doctor does think this will settle down now that I have finished exams. Do you think there is a chance it could? I have mentioned this query to another doctor online, and he believed it may be due to an overactive bladder. However, since I am relatively young to receive this diagnosis, I wanted a second opinion, if that is alright. Do you think this could be OAB? I am worried that it could be something serious, like multiple sclerosis. One and a half years ago, I had an episode of sudden onset numbness in one arm and fearing the same thing, I ended up having an MRI of my brain and lumbar spine which both came back negative. Do you think this could be MS?", "output": "Based on your symptoms, it appears that you might be suffering from an overactive bladder or a possible urinary tract infection (UTI). The workup of UTIs includes microscopy and culture of the urine, which you already have completed. Another possibility is that stress and anxiety are contributing to your symptoms - this can occur even if you aren't feeling immediately stressed.\n\nThe likelihood of multiple sclerosis (MS) seems low given your recent negative MRI and lack of other neurological symptoms. It's important to understand that MS generally presents with signs beyond just bladder issues, such as muscle weakness, vision problems, balance problems, and more.\n\nWhile you may feel concerned about Overactive Bladder due to your age, remember that while it's more common in older adults, younger people can also experience these symptoms.\n\nFollowing through with the course of antibiotics will help rule out any lingering infection. If your symptoms persist after the course of antibiotic treatment, it would be advisable to seek further evaluation by a urologist who could perform additional testing like urodynamic studies or cystoscopy to provide a more specific diagnosis.\n\nRemember to keep well hydrated \u2013 inadequate water intake can irritate the bladder and make symptoms worse. Avoiding caffeine and alcohol can also improve symptoms as they can stimulate the bladder. Pelvic floor exercises (\"Kegel\" exercises) can often strengthen the muscles that hold urine in the bladder and prevent leakage. \n\nAs always, please consult with your local healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and treatment because this advice"}

It includes symptoms like dry eyes, eye discomfort and blurred vision.\n\nGlasses specific for computer use are available in the market and they're often referred to as Computer Glasses or Blue Light Glasses. Here are some characteristics of these lenses:\n\n1. Anti-Reflective Coating: This reduces glare from the computer screen that can contribute to eye strain.\n\n2. Blue Light Blocking: These glasses filter out blue light emitted by screens. Excessive exposure to this high-energy visible (HEV) light can damage the eye's retina and potentially contribute to age-related macular degeneration.\n\n3. Bifocal/Single Vision: Depending upon your needs, you could get bifocals (which correct both near and distance views), or single vision computer glasses specifically designed for intermediate viewing distance.\n\n4. Tinted Lenses: Some computer glasses also come with a subtle yellow tint to offset the color distortion caused by blue-light filtering.\n\nBefore choosing any eyewear, I would recommend that you consult an optometrist for an eye examination.

Symptoms are worse at night when the female worms are most active and crawl out of the anus to deposit their eggs.\n\nAlthough \"vibrations\" might not be a common description for pinworm related sensations, it could potentially describe the movement of these tiny worms.\n\nPrescription medicines such as mebendazole and over-the-counter medication like Reese's Pinworm Medicine (pyrantel pamoate) are effective treatments. It often involves two doses 2 weeks apart to help prevent reinfection. Discussion with your physician would be important before starting medications. \n\nRegarding home remedies like apple cider vinegar, garlic, and carrots: these are traditional remedies which people believe may create an inhospitable environment for the pinworms, however there isn\u2019t much scientific data supporting their effectiveness.

My hemoglobin is 16.", "output": "I'm sorry, as a text-based AI, I don't have the ability to review images or physical symptoms. However, darkness in nails can be normal for some people and may be due to increased melanin production, particularly if it's something you've had since childhood.

I had a habit of masturbation before my marriage. Please suggest.", "output": "This sounds like you might be experiencing what is known as erectile dysfunction. This can sometimes happen due to physical reasons such as certain medical conditions (like diabetes, cardiovascular diseases), lifestyle factors (obesity, smoking, alcohol consumption), side effects of medications, or due to psychological factors such as stress, anxiety especially related to sexual performance, depression etc.\n\nSince the onset seems to be since your marriage, it could be potentially related to anxiety or psychological stresses. If you have been masturbating without problem before marriage, this may suggest that there's not a physical issue causing the erectile dysfunction. \n\nBut, remember this is just an educated guess based on your description. It would be best if you see a healthcare professional in person who can evaluate and investigate the situation thoroughly, which often includes both a physical examination and discussing personal issues that might affect the condition. \n\nIf it still concerns you might want to see Urologist or Sexologist depending on availability in your area, they are those professionals who are often experienced dealing with these sort of conditions. Also involved could be a psychologist or psychiatrist, particularly if the root cause is assessed to be psychological in nature."}

She is my maternal uncle\\s daughter. She is a close relative. Can our marriage create a reduced genetic pool? Can I marry the girl? Will I have kids if I marry her? Will I have a future kid without genetic defects? What are tests needed to be done if I want to marry the girl in close relation first or second order? As I have read reduced genetic pool can create abnormalities as common genes which are suppressed may become active in the next generation. Please guide in this issue.", "output": "Marrying someone with the same blood group does not pose any problems constitutionally or genetically. However, marrying a close relative can indeed increase the chances of certain genetic abnormalities in children due to increased sharing of gene pool. It's important to note that it doesn't guarantee a problem, but rather increases potential risk.\n\nBefore marriage and planning for kids, it may be advisable to consult a genetic counselor, who can help assess the potential risks based on your family health history. \n\nYou could also consider premarital screening tests such as:\n\n1. Thalassemia screening.\n2. Genetic carrier testing for conditions prevalent in your ancestry or family history.\n3. Blood compatibility test\n\nMoreover, if you both decide to have kids after marriage, there is an array of prenatal diagnostic tests (amniocentesis, chorionic villus sampling etc.) and non-invasive prenatal screening tests available which assist in detecting anomalies in the fetus at an early stage. \n\nAgain, these measures do not guarantee total prevention but they significantly help in early detection and management. \n\nIn general, it's important to have an open discussion about this issue and make decisions according to both of your comfort levels and understanding."}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hi doctor,I have been taking 4 mg of Xanax a day to treat severe panic attack syndrome and associated high levels of general anxiety for 15 years. My doctor arrived at the 4 mg per day amount gradually and it works very well along with CBT from a therapist. Before two months, when I received the medication from the pharmacy it was for 3 mg /day. I asked them to double check and that was the quantity that my doctor had written. I call his office and the office manager said that she would ask him about it. When I called the next day she said that he did not make a mistake and I asked for an explanation and was told that he did not give one.I started to feel sick a few days later and panic attacks actually started to increase the day that I talk to his office manager. I suffered minor but disruptive withdrawal symptoms physically and mentally for about two weeks and then they subsided but panic attacks continued to occur at random every day and my GAD symptoms increased to the point where CBT methods were not working.Then last month, the script was back to 4 mg per day normal dosage. I thought yes, back to normal. But again this month the script was back down to 3 mg per day which means I am going to experience a minor hell again.I am a defense and aerospace engineer who works on a contract basis through an agency and the client had noticed a drop in my performance before month but back to normal last month, now they are going to see it again and I will probably lose the contract job. I also started online system engineer classes and I am freaking out over being able to handle the exams and homework as I typically work on the class at night and am now without my evening dose. I again asked for an explanation and was not given any.My question is a 25% cut in dosage physically dangerous and I am well aware of the strong psychological addition issues, so will this settle down before my career and social life and general well being take a hit and I revert to hiding in my apartment with my dog and my employer and friends will give up on me.", "output": "I'm sorry to hear about the challenges you've been experiencing. It's important to note that abrupt or severe changes in dosage of benzodiazepines like Xanax, especially after long-term use, can cause withdrawal symptoms and increased panic attacks or anxiety, as you're experiencing.\n\nA sudden 25% cut from 4mg to 3mg per day might be too drastic for some patients used to a higher dose. However, it's also essential to note that long-term treatment with Xanax is typically not recommended due to dependency issues and other side effects. Tapering off should ideally be done slowly under doctor supervision - reduction rate will usually depend on duration of usage, typical dose, etc., and could range between 10% to 25% every 2 to 4 weeks.\n\nThis doesn't amount to a medical emergency, but rapid fluctuations and lack of consistency may affect your mental health and daily functioning substantially. I recommend seeking an appointment with your prescribing doctor promptly to discuss your concerns and a suitable tapering plan, if necessary. You could consider involving a pharmacist or another healthcare provider if needed. Ultimately, long term strategies to manage your panic disorder and GAD would lean towards psychotherapy and potentially considering other classes of anti-anxiety medication to minimise dependence.\n\nAdditionally, remember emergencies do happen: if you ever feel extremely unwell or suicidal, seek immediate help from a local emergency department.\n\nDo note this advice is intended to be general in nature, please consult with a healthcare provider"}

My query is that I walk regularly brisk and my pulse goes up to 145 and 150 without any breathlessness and recovery is also good as it drops around 25 points within one minute. Does this mean my heart does not have plaque and I am safe? After 150 pulse, slight discomfort or maybe anxiety but no breathlessness. I am very scared to do TMT test but also anxious to know that if I am able to touch 150 pulse without any issue that means my heart is in perfect condition?", "output": "Firstly, it is important to note that an elevated heart rate during exercise such as brisk walking is normal. Your pulse response and recovery are within the anticipated range for physical exertion. Remember, everyone's maximum heart rate is roughly 220 minus their age. So for you, a max heart rate could be around 180.\n\nHowever, while being able to reach and recover from a high pulse rate can indicate a level of heart fitness, it does not completely rule out the presence of plaque or other types of heart disease. It provides limited information about your overall cardiovascular health. Regular physical activity is beneficial, but it doesn't necessarily mean your heart is in perfect condition without further investigation.\n\nAdditionally, individuals who are overweight are at higher risk for developing heart disease, even if other factors like cholesterol and blood pressure are under control. Losing weight may help reduce this risk.\n\nI understand you are feeling anxious about taking a treadmill stress test. However, I still recommend that you talk through these fears with your doctor. TMT is a safe and controlled way to assess the heart's response to stress/exercise and it can provide valuable information on the state of your heart health.\n\nRemember to always consult with your healthcare provider for any concerns regarding your heart or overall health."}

Today, I noticed a small white spot beneath my tongue and a white area inside my cheek. I am very much worried about this. Please help me.", "output": "I understand your concern. The white spots or area inside the mouth could be due to a variety of reasons; it might simply just be a mild fungal infection like oral thrush, oral lichen planus, traumatic ulcer, or leukoplakia which can occur with prolonged use of gutkha/pan masala, and sometimes these changes may progress towards cancer.\n\nIt's hard to confirm without a physical examination so I would recommend you stop consuming gutkha/pan masala immediately and visit a dentist or an oral pathologist for thorough investigation. It's important to get any such symptoms checked as early diagnosis often leads to better outcomes. Also remember, certain forms of oral cancer are extremely preventable with the elimination of risk factors like tobacco and alcohol.\n \nDon't panic, but make sure you address this by seeing a professional."}

Without actually being able to physically assess your mother or see her radiographs and medical reports, I can only give general advice.\n\nFirstly, femur plasmacytoma can definitely cause bone damage and this might be the reason for continually failed prosthesis. The prostheses are meant to replace the joint but if they keep getting infected, there might be other factors at play. The paralysis of external popliteus will also affect muscle contraction and mobility thereby affecting proper use of the prosthesis.\n\nUsing a Megasystem-C Link prosthesis is indeed an option but it is largely dependant on how fit your mother is, her overall health conditions also considering the potential challenges which as you mentioned includes risk of amputation. This prosthesis will replace both hip and knee joint providing a more stable construct that could prevent infection spread through the tissues.\n\nThe suggestion to add bone pieces is a possibility too, in a procedure known as bone grafting where bone tissue is transplanted to replace and recreate bone structure. However, availability of sufficient healthy bone for grafting and consolidation would remain areas of concern particularly due to her history of plasmacytoma.\n\nGetting a second opinion from another orthopedic specialist would be a very good idea, especially one experienced in cases like this.

I want to get an opinion about this before thinking about Ahmed valve.", "output": "The course of treatment, particularly for a complex case like your mom's with multiple treatments and laser procedures in the past, will largely depend on her overall medical condition, tolerance to potential risks and benefits related to these procedures. \n\nAhmed Valve Implants are generally reserved for complex cases or when other therapies have failed to control intraocular pressure. Like all surgeries, it does carry some risks including hypotony (too low eye pressure), blockage of the valve, erosion of the tissue covering the implant, infection, swelling and inflammation.\n\nMinimally Invasive Glaucoma Surgery (MIGS) is indeed showing promise for lowering IOP with fewer complications. Xen Gel Stent and InnFocus Microshunt fall into this category. They are less invasive than traditional glaucoma surgery and have shown substantial success- coupled with potentially fewer complications compared to conventional therapy. However, long term effects and success rates for these methods are still under investigation as they are comparatively newer.\n\nBoth types of surgery come with their own sets of risks and benefits. It would be worth discussing both options in detail with the ophthalmologist who knows your mother's case well.

Stretch marks are NOT a disease but a normal skin condition that occurs often during periods of rapid growth or changes in body size.\n\nThese changes may occur due to:\n1. Rapid growth: Teenagers might see them during growth spurts.\n2. Pregnancy: Most women will get them sometime after their sixth or seventh month of pregnancy\n3. Weight gain: People who gain a lot of weight quickly, like bodybuilders, can get stretch marks.\n4. Medical conditions: Certain diseases, like Marfan syndrome or Cushing's syndrome, can cause stretch marks.\n\nThe skin contains three key layers: epidermis (the outer layer), dermis (the middle layer), and subcutaneous (the deepest layer). Stretch marks form in the dermis when the connective tissue is stretched beyond its flexibility limits due to rapid expansion or contraction of the skin. As skin is stretched, the collagen is weakened and its regular production cycle is interrupted and damaged. This eventually results in scar-like striations on the skin's surface that we know as stretch marks.\n\nHere are some ways to prevent stretch marks:\n1.

The use of a moisturizer to counteract this dryness can be beneficial.\n\nGlycolic Acid and Vitamin C have exfoliating properties and they can cause irritation when used alongside Tretinoin, especially if you've just started the treatment. Hence, I would suggest introducing them into your routine slowly and carefully. If you do decide to use the product with Vitamin C and Glycocalic Acid, apply it in the morning instead of at night with Tretinoin as an excess of active ingredients may irritate the skin significantly.\n\nAlso, remember that Tretinoin makes your skin more susceptible to sun-damage so always use a sunblock during the day. Start by using Tretinoin every third night for the first two weeks then increase to every other night and finally nightly if tolerable.\n\nAs always, this advice could vary based on individual skin sensitivities, so monitor your reactions closely and slow down or discontinue use if you notice excessive redness, peeling, or irritation."}

I find her too short compared to her friends, my wife is only 5 feet tall and I myself is 5\\7\". Is this the reason she is not growing, since last 4 to 5 months her height is the same, or due to adenoids or medication which she took in the past?What should we do regarding her height? I want her to be at least 5\\4\", up to what age girls height can grow? She takes Pediasure, two eggs in terms of protein every day and four days a week swimming, is there anything special I can do? Kindly advise.", "output": "As a doctor, I can tell you that height growth in children is mainly influenced by genetics. Roughly 60%-80% of your child's final adult height is determined by hereditary factors - basically from both the mother and father's height. At 6.5 years old, it's typical for girls to be between 111-134 cm tall so your daughter\u2019s height falls within the normal range.\n\nRemember every child grows at their own pace. It can be deceiving when comparing them with peers as some may have growth spurts earlier or later than others.\n\nMedical conditions such as adenoids could potentially affect growth if they result in significant sleep disturbances or nutritional problems, but these tend to influence weight rather than height. \n\nGiven her past history of seizures and associated medications, there might be an impact on her growth too. However, since she has been off medication for three years now and considering her current age, the effect would probably be less significant.\n\nIn terms of nutrition, ensure she is getting enough calcium and Vitamin D along with protein which are important for bone growth. In terms of physical activity, swimming is excellent.\n\nRegarding height growth potential, most girls will reach their final adult height by the time they are 15 or 16, after which point significant growth is unlikely. Some small increases up to age 20 are possible but not common.\n\nYour pediatrician should be tracking her growth on standard growth charts.

Earlier, I passed clots that look like blood mixed with chicken meat. I am terrified. Is this a side effect or do I need to go to the ER? Please help.", "output": "The clotting you are experiencing could very likely be associated with your uterine fibroid and the hormonal treatments (the Depo shot following Provera) you've been given to manage your intermenstrual bleeding. These clots may represent menstrual blood mixed with endometrial tissue that is not smoothly shedding. While this can be disconcerting, it's not generally considered a medical emergency. However, if you are feeling extreme discomfort, experiencing severe pain, or notice an increase in the size or frequency of these clots, I would recommend contacting your healthcare provider immediately.\n\nYou should also seek immediate medical attention if you're losing large quantities of blood, getting dizzy, lightheaded, or feel like you might faint. Do keep your doctor updated about these changes as potential adjustments to your medication or further tests might be necessary. It sounds like you are under ongoing management so maintaining open communication with your doctor/healthcare provider will help guide appropriate next steps.

Please answer.", "output": "I'm sorry to hear you're experiencing these symptoms, but keep in mind that I can only provide general advice based on the information provided. In terms of your suspicion about Sjogren's syndrome, this is a chronic autoimmune condition most commonly affecting the moisture-producing glands like those responsible for tears and saliva. The symptoms you described (dry eyes, dry mouth, photosensitivity) can indeed be connected with it, though other conditions may also cause similar symptoms.\n\nSjogren's syndrome has no cure, but the treatment focuses on managing symptoms. For dry eyes, artificial tears or ointments could help as they replace the missing tear fluid. Prescription eye drops like cyclosporine or lifitegrast might improve tear production. Punctal plugs or surgery could also be considered in severe cases to slow tear drainage. \n\nDry mouth management includes sipping on water throughout the day, maintaining good oral hygiene, using saliva substitutes or prescription drugs such as pilocarpine or cevimeline which stimulate salivary glands. \n\nRegarding photosensitivity, protecting oneself from sunlight by wearing protective clothing, sunglasses and applying sunscreen would be helpful.\n\nThough it seems plausible, we cannot conclude yet that your current issues are caused by Sjogren's syndrome without further testing. Other possibilities could be side effects from specific medications, other systemic diseases or simply post-infectious symptomatology since you mentioned a recent course of antibiotics.

I would like to know which type of bleeding is dangerous? And also explain the reason for the same.", "output": "I'm sorry to hear about your condition. \n\nStroke is a serious medical event that occurs when the blood flow to your brain is reduced or interrupted, resulting in damage to brain cells. The bleeding you're referring to might be associated with a type of stroke called a hemorrhagic stroke, which involves bleeding within the brain. Hemorrhagic strokes can be subcategorized further into intracerebral (within the brain) and subarachnoid (between the brain and the thin tissues covering it).\n\nBoth acute and chronic bleeding can present problems. Acute bleeding is sudden and severe, often causing more immediate symptoms like sudden intense headache, decreased alertness, nausea and vomiting, changes in vision, etc. Immediate medical attention is essential in such cases to help limit the extent of damage.\n\nChronic bleeding, on the other hand, may happen over a longer duration. While this might sound less severe, it's not necessarily less dangerous because symptoms are subtler and can be overlooked, leading to delayed diagnoses and treatment which can result in substantial neurological damage over time.\n\nIn summary, both types of bleedings are potentially dangerous as they might lead to the damage of brain cells, risk of increased pressure inside your skull and even death. The amount of damage and prognosis depend largely on the size and location of the hematoma (blood clot), rapidity of onset of hemorrhage and the individual\u2019s general health condition.\n\nIf you experience any symptom of stroke, always seek emergency medical aid immediately.\nIt is ideal"}

Yes, the gaps can usually be closed in a number of ways:\n\n1. Orthodontic Treatment: Braces or clear aligners like Invisalign could be used to incrementally move your teeth together and close the gap. This process could take several months to a couple of years depending on the size of the gap and is typically done under the supervision of an orthodontist.\n\n2. Dental Bonding: If the gap is minor, dental bonding (direct composite veneers) could be a good option. Your dentist uses a tooth-colored material to fill in the gap. This doesn't necessarily involve moving the teeth but rather gives the illusion that the gap isn't present.\n\n3. Dental Veneers or Crowns: Another cosmetic solution for larger gaps involves attaching thin coverings onto the front parts of your teeth. These veneers or crowns could be tailored to any shape or size to fit your specific need.\n\n4. Dental Implants/Bridge: If the gap is because you've lost one or more teeth, then implants or a bridge could be an option for you. The implant essentially provides an artificial tooth root upon which a false tooth can be placed. A bridge works by using the two teeth on either side of the gap as anchors for a false tooth or set of teeth.\n\nThe best treatment method would depend on various factors such as the extent of the gap, the condition of your teeth and gums, and personal preference.

I was suffering slightly with dizziness prior to the tinnitus four months back which had cleared by then.", "output": "While tinnitus is not a common side effect of Sudafed (pseudoephedrine), it's possible that your symptoms may be indirectly related. Sudafed works by constricting the blood vessels in your nasal passages, reducing the swelling and congestion. However, this can sometimes cause an increased blood pressure, which has been associated with tinnitus in some cases.\n\nIt's also important to note that sinus congestion or inflammation itself can occasionally trigger tinnitus. If the problem persists after discontinuing the Sudafed, I would recommend getting evaluated by an ear, nose, and throat specialist. This will help uncover if there are any underlying issues such as Eustachian tube dysfunction, middle ear infection, or Meniere's disease, which could contribute to the development of tinnitus.\n\nFor now, stop using the nasal spray and monitor for changes in your symptoms.

Tinnitus can be frustrating and it can often be difficult to find the root cause of the problem. The audiogram that was performed would have determined if there was hearing loss, which is often associated with tinnitus. \n\nHowever, as your doctors have ruled out ear disease or hearing loss as potential sources of the problem, you might need further tests to rule out other possible causes for tinnitus:\n\n1. Imaging Tests: In some cases, a CT scan or MRI might be ordered to check for any abnormalities in your brain or ear structures.\n   \n2. Blood Work: Your doctor might order blood tests to identify medical conditions related to tinnitus such as anemia, high cholesterol, thyroid problems, kidney function, etc.\n\n3. Vascular Assessment: This test will determine whether blood flow issues are causing your tinnitus.\n\n4. Neurological Examinations: These can pinpoint neurological disorders contributing to tinnitus.\n\nAs for management, while antibiotics can potentially treat infections that may lead to tinnitus, they won't help if the cause is something else. Currently, there's no specific drug therapy approved by FDA specifically for treating tinnitus but management strategies do exist, including:\n\n1. Counselling: Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) can alleviate distress from tinnitus by changing people's reaction to it. Mindfulness techniques could also be helpful.\n\n2.

Conscious sedation (also known as IV sedation) is a type of anesthesia that makes you very relaxed and sleepy, but does not always make you entirely unconscious. \n\nYou remain awake and can respond to commands (like raising your hand), yet due to the nature of the medications used, most patients remember little to nothing at all about their procedures afterward because these medications also have amnesic properties.

General anesthesia may be an option, but it depends on your overall health, the complexity of the oral surgery, and the practices/preferences of your surgeons. This might require different consent forms and carries its risks too which should be thoroughly understood before making a decision."}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,I am 16 years old. I have started taking a protein supplement since yesterday. I passed black stools this morning. Is this black color because of the protein powder?", "output": "Black stools can sometimes be a cause for concern as it might indicate bleeding from the upper gastrointestinal tract. However, they are also often caused by certain foods, iron supplements, or medications like Pepto-Bismol. Protein powders typically do not cause black stools.\n\nIf you have recently started taking an iron supplement or eaten dark-colored foods such as licorice or blueberries, these could potentially result in black stool. If not, and especially if you also experience symptoms like stomach pain, dizziness, fainting, or vomiting, I would advise seeking medical attention immediately as these could be signs of internal bleeding.\n\nThat being said, given that this is new onset after starting a protein supplement, I would recommend stopping the supplement temporarily to see if your stool returns to its normal color. If it does not change back within 2-3 days or if other concerning symptoms arise, it would be critical to seek out medical evaluation promptly. Always ensure to consult with your healthcare provider before starting any new supplements."}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hi doctor,I am a 32 year old female, and I weigh 57 kg. I am work in a bank, which keeps me out of home from 9 AM to 7 PM. I was diagnosed with PCOS, and I have a 1.5 mm intramural fibroid on the posterior wall of the uterus since two years. I am taking Glyciphage SR 500 since then, and it has kept my period as well as ovulation regular. My menstrual cycle is 28 to 31 days now. My husband is 33 years old, and he weighs 72 kg, and his job keeps him away from home for 12 hours. He is suffering from erectile dysfunction from last year. His semen analysis revealed slow sperm, and he has been on Edon and Maxoza since three months.We went for IUI last month, and my husband has 10 million motile sperm count. The fertility specialist at the clinic told it is too low for IUI and suggested IVF with ICSI since IUI is only time and money loss. Is it necessary to do IVF with ICSI in our case? Since I have PCOS, can I suffer from OHSS during IVF? I am a working woman, do I need to take long breaks from the job while going IVF treatment? Can I go for single embryo transfer? Is bed rest needed after embryo transfer or during the entire IVF procedure?", "output": "Given what you've shared, it is understandable why your fertility specialist recommended IVF with ICSI due to your husband's low motile sperm count. Yes, IVF with ICSI may increase chances of conception n this case as it specifically selects and injects a healthy sperm into each egg. Assisted reproductive technologies (ART) like these are commonly used in cases where male factor infertility is a contributor. \n\nHowever, women with PCOS do face an elevated risk of developing Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS). OHSS is a condition where the ovaries respond too well to fertility drugs and produce many eggs. Symptoms could range from mild bloating to severe abdominal pain. It is advisable to discuss this concern directly with your treating doctor who will manage and minimize the risk of possible complications.\n\nMany women continue working during their IVF procedures. You may require some time off for important visits or procedures such as egg retrieval and embryo transfer but other than that, regular activity can usually be maintained.\n\nYou can request for single embryo transfer (SET). Transfer of multiple embryos increases the chance of multiple pregnancies which carries associated risks. SET has been gaining preference to limit the likelihood of twins or triplet pregnancies while maintaining a good success rate.\n\nBed rest after an embryo transfer isn't typically required, however, some doctors recommend it only out of precaution. Each clinic may vary slightly on recommendations following embryo transfer but generally speaking, returning to normal non-strenuous activities is often advised.

{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,I fell over seven weeks ago at a running competition (at the end of a race), and had subsequent knee pain, swelling and difficulty walking. I then proceeded to have an X-ray which ruled out any fractures and then an MRI which showed a partial PCL tear. I have been having physiotherapy on it since including leg strengthening exercises. However, severe pain still persists, no improvement from the pain felt two weeks post-injury. Does this indicate it is not healing?", "output": "As a doctor, based on your description, it's hard for me to say definitively without examining you directly. However, the fact that pain is persisting despite physiotherapy and leg strengthening exercises may suggest there are further complications or another undetected injury in addition to the partial PCL tear. \n\nHowever, it's also worth bearing in mind that healing times can vary greatly based on the severity of the injury, age, overall health condition etc. Typically, minor to moderate ligament tears like a partial PCL tear heal within 4-8 weeks with physical therapy, but some cases could take longer particularly if they're not given adequate rest or the rehabilitation plan isn't followed strictly.\n\nI would recommend going back to your healthcare provider and discussing this with them. They might need to adjust your treatment plan, or approach your recovery from another angle, such as considering pain management strategies. Rarely, surgical intervention may be required depending on the circumstances. Remember, do not stop your physio regimen unless directed by your healthcare provider.\n"}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,I had chest pain. In my 2D echo report, septum jerky is given. What does is it mean? The doctor said the heart is fine.", "output": "A \"jerky septum\" in an echocardiogram report may refer to some abnormal movement of the septal wall, which is a part of the internal dividing wall within the heart. This could potentially be due to a number of conditions, from benign issues such as hyperdynamic circulation (increased blood flow) to various forms of heart diseases.\n\nHowever, if your doctor has reviewed the report and said your heart is fine, it's likely that the finding may not be clinically significant or urgent. In medicine, many variations can exist which do not impact overall health or function.\n\nThat being said, depending upon the rest of your medical history, symptoms, and risk factors for heart disease, further investigation might still be needed to clarify this finding. You should continue to communicate with your doctor about any ongoing or new symptoms you're experiencing to ensure appropriate management of your condition."}

But monthly three to four days, I need to do presentations in my office, and due to the allergy, the quality of my work goes down. Presently, I am using some herbal medicines, that is, turmeric for reduction of histamine and it works a little and reduces a few symptoms. I am requesting you to provide me the tablet for reduction of excess histamine in the body or medicine to prevent the production of histamine in the body. If histamine level is normal in my body, I can experience calmness and happiness. But if histamine levels are increased due to allergy, I feel some kind of discomfort. So to avoid discomfort asking medicine to reduce histamine levels.", "output": "Based on your symptoms and the reported benefits of the natural remedies you're currently using, it sounds like medication that inhibits histamine release or blocks histamine receptors may be beneficial for managing your allergic symptoms. \n\nAntihistamines work by blocking H1 receptors (a type of histamine receptor in our bodies), thus reducing the effects of the histamine released during an allergic reaction. Some examples of common antihistamines include cetirizine (Zyrtec), fexofenadine (Allegra), and loratadine (Claritin).\n\nOn the other hand, if lifestyle modifications and over-the-counter antihistamines aren't enough, a doctor may consider prescribing medications like corticosteroids which can help reduce inflammation caused by allergies.\n\nHowever, it's important to consult with your healthcare provider before starting any new medication. They will be able to provide you with a thorough assessment and determine what is the most appropriate treatment based on your specific condition, medical history, and potential side effects of the drugs."}

Please help.", "output": "It sounds like you are dealing with post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. This occurs when a pimple, bug bite, or other irritation causes increased pigment production in that spot, leading to what looks like a dark spot left behind after the main issue has resolved.\n\nFirstly, it's very important not to pick at your pimples as this can lead to long-term scarring. Keeping your skin clean and using products tailored to acne-prone skin may help reduce the occurrence of new pimples. \n\nFor treating the existing spots, some things might be tried:\n1. Sunscreen: It helps prevent further darkening.\n2. Over-the-counter treatments: Retinoid creams, Hydroquinone etc., Consult a pharmacist for more information.\n3. Chemical peels: They remove the top layer of your skin and might lighten dark spots.\n4. Injectable treatments.\n  \nRemember, these treatments take time. You're unlikely to see immediate results but over weeks to months, the colour should start becoming lighter.\n\nHowever, if none of these works, I would recommend consulting a dermatologist as there could be underlying conditions causing your pimples and subsequent post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation.

Please suggest me a good medicine to cure it. Is NFcure capsules a good option in curing it?", "output": "Nightfall, or nocturnal emissions, is not usually a condition that requires medication. It's actually very common and typically happens when your body responds to the normal hormonal changes associated with puberty and young adulthood. The occurrences could reduce over time as you grow older.\n\nExhaustion, dizziness, and lack of concentration may be caused by other factors such as stress, poor sleep quality, improper diet, and dehydration among others. Therefore, it might not be linked directly to nightfall.\n\nI would, however, recommend maintaining a healthy lifestyle \u2013 that includes regular exercise, eating a balanced diet, staying well hydrated, adequate sleep, and stress management. These steps will help in overall health improvement and can enhance concentration.\n\nIn regards to NFcure capsules, some people claim it helps but there isn't much scientific evidence supporting this claim. Moreover, they can have side effects, so I wouldn't recommend taking them without consulting with a healthcare professional first.\n\nFinally, if symptoms persist or get worse, it's important that you see a doctor or healthcare provider in person to discuss your symptoms more comprehensively.

I am only in week one and my skin seems to have slightly worsened, with a really big hard lump on one side of my face. Do they work by drawing the impurities to the surface initially, and is my reaction normal?", "output": "Lymecycline is commonly used to treat acne and other bacterial infections. When you start the medication, it may initially cause an outbreak or make your skin appear worse because it starts acting on the previously unseen inflammation under your skin surface. However, this doesn't mean it's drawing out impurities but rather attacking bacteria that contribute to your skin problems.\n\nThe large lump on your face could be a cyst or nodule related to acne. It is important to continue with the prescribed treatment and not squeeze or pick at any pimples as this can lead to further infection and scarring.\n\nIt typically takes about 8-10 weeks for noticeable improvement with most systemic acne treatments like Lymecycline. So please remain patient, continue taking your medication as instructed, and maintain a good facial cleansing routine. \n\nHowever, if your symptoms significantly worsen, cause severe pain, or persist after several weeks of therapy, reach out to your healthcare provider to discuss your concerns."}

When will do I get the rubber bands and power chain? I hope you can tell me some more information I am looking forward to.", "output": "Hello! The sequence and timetable of orthodontic treatments vary from patient to patient, depending on the complexity of your case and how your teeth respond to treatment.\n\nIn many treatment plans, tongue spikes or \"cribs\" might be added early on if you exhibit a tongue-thrusting behavior. This can help prevent the tongue from pushing against your teeth and affecting their alignment. So it is possible that these may be added during your next visit but your orthodontist will make that decision based on your specific situation.\n\nAs for rubber bands (elastics) and power chains, they're often used later in the treatment when most of the heavy tooth movement has been done. Rubber bands are typically used to align the upper and lower jaws, while power chains can close gaps between teeth. However, the exact timing will depend upon the judgment of your orthodontist and the progress of your treatment.\n\nAlways remember to follow the advice of your orthodontist as he/she knows best about your dental conditions.

She has experience as a dentist for 30 years; still she does not wear gloves. I am wondering, is this practice safe? My mother cried during the procedure, but the dentist told it will not pain. My mother cried because of fear. I am looking forward to hear from you. Thank you.", "output": "I'm sorry to hear of your mother's discomfort during her dental visit. Dentists are expected to follow certain standards for patient comfort and safety. \n\nFirstly, the use of gloves is considered standard in any medical procedure not just for the protection of the doctor but also for the patient. Gloves prevent transmission of infectious diseases. If this dentist was not wearing gloves, it represents a significant breach in infection control practices.\n\nSecondly, the use of hammer and chisel seems quite archaic for a dental extraction. Modern dentistry has adopted far less traumatic methods for tooth removal that cause minimal pain and stress to the patient. It should be noted that each case may vary though.\n\nFinally, about alleviation of pain - local anesthesia should have been applied before the procedure to numb the area where the tooth needed to be extracted. Therefore, if the tooth was being removed correctly, it would not be painful. Your mother's fear could certainly have contributed to her level of discomfort, however, effective communication from the dentist regarding the procedure can significantly reduce fear and anxiety.\n\nI would recommend considering another dentist who follows rigorous infection control protocols and uses modern techniques for procedures to ensure comfort and safety."}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,I made an STD test, and the doctor said that I have antibodies for herpes type 1 but not infected with the virus, exposed. Does this mean I am infected, and will these antibodies transferred to my partner or will disappear with time? I have attached the report. For mycoplasma, it is already treated.", "output": "If your test results show antibodies for herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), it means that you've been infected with the virus at some point. When you get infected with HSV, your immune system creates antibodies to fight off the infection; these antibodies can be detected in the blood long after the initial infection is over, often for a lifetime. It's important to understand that having antibodies does not mean you're currently experiencing an outbreak or that you're actively shedding the virus (which could cause symptomatic disease or asymptomatic viral shedding).\n\nYou cannot transmit the antibodies themselves to someone else. However, even without symptoms, those infected with herpes can still occasionally shed the virus and possibly infect others, although this risk is much lower than during active outbreaks.\n\nThe presence of HSV-1 antibodies also doesn't mean the virus itself will disappear over time. Herpes is a lifelong infection; once you have it, the virus lies dormant in your nerve cells and can reactivate periodically. Whether your HSV-1 infection manifests as oral or genital herpes depends on the site of original exposure (normally oral for HSV-1, though genital infections are increasingly common).\n\nFor Mycoplasma, if you were treated successfully then repeated testing should be negative. But make sure you notify all recent sexual partners as they may need treatment too to prevent reinfection.\n\nLastly, keep using protective measures like condoms during sexual activity to reduce the risk of transmitting HSV or acquiring other sexually transmitted infections.

The CT and MRI showed only tumor and no other problem. Last week, the EEG report showed normal. How to find whether the seizure is caused by the tumor or by the trauma or both?", "output": "The EEG being normal could mean that your seizure might not be due to a typical epileptogenic focus, but it doesn't completely rule out epilepsy or the fact that the seizure may have originated from a localized area such as tumor/trauma.\n\nIn general, seizures can occur due to brain trauma (post-traumatic epilepsy) especially in the first year after injury, and they are often focal seizures, starting from the damaged part of the brain.\n\nRegarding the tumor, depending on its size, location, type, and progression, it also could provoke seizures by irritating the surrounding brain tissue or by increasing pressure on it. \n\nDetermining whether the seizure is caused by the tumor or trauma would require careful correlation between clinical symptoms, EEG findings, imaging studies (MRI or CT), and possibly additional studies like Positron Emission Tomography (PET scan). It's important to discuss these results with your neurologist or neurosurgeon who will be able to combine all this information to pinpoint the probable cause of the seizures.\n\nRemember that managing both conditions (tumor and post-traumatic sequelae) simultaneously is crucial in controlling seizures, which means regular follow-up visits, control MRI scans, and anti-epileptic treatment adjustments as necessary."}

The Endodontist has done root canal treatment in these teeth and crowns were placed after the treatment. Recently, I experienced pain around the gums in the second molar and there is a pain radiating to the head. I went to my dentist. He examined and took an X-ray which looked fine. The crown was removed and cleaned by the Hygienist with a Listerine or Peroxide mix. There were food particles and they cleared the food particles present in the crown. My dentist advised me to take tablet Zyrtec every day. The teeth still have a dull type of pain. Could it be an issue of the crown that has not been shown on the X-ray or there is any allergies?", "output": "As a doctor, it isn't possible for me to diagnose your condition without an examination and more detailed information. However, I can share that your symptoms may correspond to one of several things:\n\n1) It could be residual infection: Sometimes the original infection that required the root canal treatment persists and flare-ups can occur, especially if there was any part of the root system missed during the original procedure.\n\n2) Referred pain from some other tooth or jaw problem: Sometimes problems with other teeth or jaw structures (temporomandibular joint - TMJ) can cause referred pain which seems to come from the molar area. \n\n3) Ill-fitting crown or Tooth decay under the crown: Although you noted that the x-ray appeared fine, sometimes minute issues are missed on radiographs.\n\n4)Post Root Canal Pain: Mild discomfort for a few days to a few weeks after root canal therapy is also normal.\n\n5) Sinusitis: Especially in the upper molars, as they are near to the sinus cavities.  \n\nUsing an antihistamine like Zyrtec could suggest your dentist might suspect some kind of allergy or hypersensitivity being at play, possibly relating to material used in the crown. Continual swelling or pain can indicate rejection/ intolerance to the materials used, but it's less common. If your issue continues and isn\u2019t resolving, the best course is to visit your dentist again, or seek a second opinion.\n"}

Will Digene help in these type of stomach pain and is it safe during pregnancy?", "output": "Throughout pregnancy, it's common for women to experience some degree of discomfort as their bodies change to support the development of the unborn baby. This can present itself as nausea and vomiting (commonly referred to as morning sickness), as well as occasional mild stomach pain. However, intense recurrent stomach pain is not typical and should be evaluated by a healthcare provider immediately to rule out complications such as ectopic pregnancy, miscarriage, gallbladder disease, or preterm labor.\n\nDoxinate is a category B drug for pregnancy, meaning it has been found to cause no harm in animal studies but hasn't been conclusively tested in humans.

It can be performed for medical reasons (such as correcting breathing problems related to the nose or correct disfigurement resulting from trauma) or for cosmetic reasons, which can change the nose's shape and appearance.\n\nThe procedure usually involves incisions within the nostrils. In some cases, cuts are made in the base of the nose. The inner cartilage and bone are then reshaped to produce a more pleasing appearance.\n\nIt's a major surgery, so you need to discuss it thoroughly with a certified surgeon before making any decisions. Research about the pre-and post-surgery care and understand the possible risks too. As for your nose growing towards left side, the surgeon would evaluate the structural issues contributing to this and suggest an appropriate treatment plan.\n\nMake sure to remember that everyone's face is asymmetrical to some degree and perfect symmetry is both impossible and unnatural. Rhinoplasty can help improve facial harmony and create balance. Ensure you have reasonable expectations before deciding on surgery."}

Basically, I never came inside her but I wanted to get educated about the facts like how to avoid pregnancy if I came inside her? I mean what should be our first step? Even if I pull out, is there any chances that she will get pregnant? Which condom is a perfect fit for starters like us? Is there any natural ways too to make sure no sperm left inside?", "output": "Hello, I appreciate you reaching out to get more information about contraception and practicing safe sex. It seems like you are being responsible in your approach. Let's address the issues one by one:\n\n1) Condoms: If condoms feel uncomfortable for you, it may be due to incorrect size or material. There are several brands available with varying sizes (standard, large, small), textures, and even materials (latex and non-latex). Try experimenting with different varieties until you find one that suits you best.\n\n2) Avoiding Pregnancy: Even if you pull out before ejaculation, there is still a chance of pregnancy as 'pre-cum' (the fluid that comes out of the penis before ejaculation) may contain sperm. The most effective way to prevent pregnancy following unprotected intercourse is Emergency Contraception (also known as Morning-after Pill). This should ideally be taken within 72 hours after unprotected sex but may work up to 120 hours later. However, regular use of emergency contraception isn't recommended and you both should consider finding a regular contraception method suitable for you, such as an intrauterine device (IUD), contraceptive pill, injection, implants etc.\n\n3) Natural Methods: There are natural methods such as tracking menstrual cycles (Fertility Awareness-Based Methods) to avoid having sex on the days when the woman is most fertile. However, this method requires accurate tracking of her periods and understanding of her cycle. Additionally, the reliability of fertility awareness-based methods can vary greatly and generally they are"}

Since I got a bit anxious about getting pregnant, I had four I-pills in these two weeks for protection. I then returned back on the 15th of this month. I had very scanty periods between the 24th to the 28th. And that is it. I had no periods after that until today. I have checked for pregnancy four times and it always showed negative. I do not have any pregnancy symptoms as well. I am leading a normal life. At times, I feel some cramps in the lower part of my stomach. I have already visited my doctor. She suggested I take Regestrone 5 mg, two tablets a day for five days. But, I still did not get my periods. Kindly advice me for the same.", "output": "Based on your description, the irregularity in your cycle could be due to hormonal imbalances caused by the use of I-pills. These pills have high doses of hormones used to prevent pregnancy and can disrupt your natural hormone balance and menstrual cycle when used repeatedly.\n\nRegarding Regestrone that your doctor prescribed, sometimes it might take up to a week after you stop taking it for your period to start. If your period doesn't show up within one week after you stopped taking Regestrone, or if you get any new unusual symptoms, consult with your physician again.\n\nMeanwhile, remember, frequent use of morning-after pill is not recommended as a regular contraceptive method. It should only be used as an emergency measure. There are various safe and effective long-term methods of contraception available. You may want to consider them and discuss this matter with your healthcare provider or doctor.\n\nKeep monitoring any changes in your body and always keep open communication with your doctor. Also try to maintain healthy lifestyle habits as it is good for overall hormonal health."}

I hear heartbeats on both right and left side of my chest and I feel that I have two hearts. Give me your advice.", "output": "Feelings like these can often be caused by the normal function of your body, including heart palpitations and the movement of stomach contents. Usually with heart beats, you should mostly feel them slightly to the left due to the positioning of the heart in your chest. However, it is also possible that what you're feeling as a heartbeat on your right side could actually be from other body functions. If this sensation is causing discomfort or anxiety, it would be best for you to consult your physician for an examination. They might schedule tests such as an electrocardiogram (ECG) to check the rhythm of your heart to rule out any cardiac conditions."}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,Six weeks ago, I started to get muscle twitches all over my body and tingling sensations in my skin. This is still happening. I visited my GP four weeks ago who immediately prescribed anti-depressants. I have suffered from health anxiety for the last seven years. It comes in waves. The GP did not even check me over and told me not to worry as he had no concern. I am worrying about motor neuron disease. However, deep down this is unlikely because someone with this illness could not go to the gym (run and push weights). I would like an opinion from an expert.", "output": "I understand your concerns, and they are completely valid. However, understand that directly jumping to motor neuron disease based on these symptoms is not generally recommended. The symptoms you're experiencing like muscle twitching and tingling sensations could arise from many conditions such as stress & anxiety (as you mentioned), vitamin deficiencies, electrolyte imbalances, among others.\n\nMotor neuron disease presents with more severe symptoms, often starting in a specific part of the body and progressing rapidly over months. These signs can include progressive muscle weakness, cramps, difficulty swallowing or speaking, and abnormal fatigue of the arms and legs.\n\nWhile those symptoms might seem similar to what you're experiencing, care should be taken not to self-diagnose this kind of illness, as it's very complex and difficult even for experts to diagnose early on.\n\nExercise tolerance doesn't necessarily rule out anything in early stages of a neurological disorder, although staying physically active is always good for general health.\n\nIt's important to address the fact that you were prescribed anti-depressants. Overlapping mental health issues can sometimes exacerbate physical symptoms, your doctor may have tried to manage your anxiety primarily. If your symptoms persist or worsen despite managing your stress levels, my recommendation would be to refer back to your GP or get a second professional opinion. \n\nYou may need an in-depth neurological assessment and potentially further tests (such as blood work, nerve conduction studies or EMG, MRIs etc) to thoroughly investigate your concerns."}

I am giving him Levolin syrup 5 ml, and for fever, I had given Babygesic 1.5 ml. Is Levolin for both cold and cough, as well as sneezing?", "output": "Levolin syrup contains Levosalbutamol which is generally used to relieve symptoms associated with asthma and other obstructive airway diseases. It works by relaxing the muscles in the walls of the small airways in the lungs, which helps to open up the airways and makes it easier for your child to breathe. While it can help with a cough if it's due to these underlying conditions, it does not treat the common cold, sneezing, or runny nose as those are typically caused by viral infections.\n\nBabygesic drops contain Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) which is an effective medication for reducing fever and providing relief from pain.\n\nIf your son's condition doesn't get better, worsens, or he develops any new symptoms such as difficulty breathing, I would strongly recommend that you reach out to his pediatrician. Without a proper physical examination and further tests, it's challenging to diagnose and prescribe appropriate treatment."}

According to the report, She has got: Fatty changes in the liver.Bulky uterus with fibroid.Blood sugar 201.0mg/dL.Kindly interpret the report.", "output": "The findings include:\n\n1. \"Fatty changes in the liver\" - This means that there are small droplets of fat within your mother's liver cells. This isn't necessarily abnormal as long as your mom doesn't drink heavily or have other risk factors for liver disease. If she does, you'll want to address these through lifestyle changes and potentially medical therapy.\n\n2. \"Bulky uterus with fibroid\" - A bulky uterus can be a natural occurrence simply due to hormonal changes as a woman ages but sometimes it is associated with benign (non-cancerous) conditions of the uterus such as uterine fibroids. Uterine fibroids are common growths in the wall of the uterus and they can cause problems like heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pressure or pain, frequent urination, difficulty emptying the bladder, constipation, backache, leg pains among others.\n\n3. \"Blood sugar 201 mg/dL\"- an elevated blood sugar level suggests either diabetes mellitus, prediabetes or a temporary increase due to stress from other illnesses. Normal fasting blood sugar should be below 100mg/dL, so this would suggest a potential diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, which requires further evaluation, including follow-up testing, and treatment if confirmed.\n   \nPlease consult her treating physician who can evaluate her overall health status and advise appropriate next steps based on these results, including possible dietary modifications, medications, monitoring of condition, etc."}

I just became worried about my vision. What else can I do to stop this progress?", "output": "As a myopia patient, it's important to have regular eye examinations (at least once every year) so your ophthalmologist can monitor the progression. While living a healthy lifestyle and maintaining good nutrition are beneficial for overall health, they may not necessarily prevent myopia from worsening.\n\nMyopia tends to progress rapidly during the growth phase in children and adolescents and then stabilizes in early adulthood. If you're still noticing a change at age 20, it would be worth further investigation by an ophthalmologist or optometrist. \n\nThere isn't a guaranteed way to stop the progression of myopia, however, there are some potential ways to slow down its progression:\n\n1. Low-dose Atropine Eye Drops: Recent studies showed that dilute concentration of atropine eye drops might slow down the progression of myopia.\n\n2. Orthokeratology: It involves fitting a series of rigid gas permeable overnight contact lenses to reshape the corneal curvature but needs professional lens fitment.\n\n3. Multifocal Contact Lenses: They provide different power zones to correct near, intermediate, and distance vision which may help in myopia control.\n\nPlease consult with your ophthalmologist to discuss these potential therapeutic strategies."}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,I am a 66 year old healthy male. I have tinnitus since two years. MRI is normal except for age-related gray area. But of late, any outside sound like flushing toilet increases the volume of tinnitus. Left ear 6/10 and right ear 4/10. The sound is the insect cricket sound. Moreover, since two weeks, I have serious sleep problems. It happened after my exposure to music played by a bus in which I traveled for five hours. That night, the sleeping problems started. Further, as I complained stiff calf muscle and a bit of pins and needle in the legs, especially after sitting in the bathroom, a nerve conduction study was taken. Before that, a VEMP test was done. Please give your opinion on those test results. Some local doctor yesterday suggested to take Niterest 0.5 mg tablet for sleeping and a relative who is a doctor suggested Melatonin 0.3 mg without any combination can be taken as it is also good for both sleep and tinnitus. Please kindly forward your opinion.", "output": "I'm sorry to hear that you're dealing with tinnitus and insomnia. It's good that you underwent an MRI, VEMP (vestibular evoked myogenic potentials) test, and a nerve conduction study. However, without specifics of those reports it would be difficult for me to provide a specific opinion.\n\nAs for your medication questions: Both Niterest (a brand name for Alprazolam in some countries) and melatonin have been used to aid sleep, but their effect on tinnitus isn't conclusive. Melatonin is generally considered safer, as it has fewer side effects and less potential for dependency compared to benzodiazepines such as Alprazolam. Also, a small dose like 0.3 mg is often sufficient to re-regulate the sleep cycle.\n\nIt's notable that sound sensitivity can be a symptom of hyperacusis, a condition where everyday noise seems much louder than it should. This condition can sometimes accompany tinnitus. There are therapies available for hyperacusis which might also help manage the volume fluctuations in your tinnitus. Regarding the stiff calf muscle and pins and needles sensation, it could be due to peripheral neuropathy or low circulation. \n\nHowever, please take this advice as a broad guidance only, as I didn't review any of your medical tests directly.\n\nAlso don't forget to incorporate lifestyle modifications: limiting caffeine and alcohol intake, maintaining regular sleep hours, daily physical activities could also bring natural improvement to your condition.

I have asked other people who I know have sprained their ankle, but they said they have never felt that. Should I be concerned? I am currently taking Advil.", "output": "Your symptoms suggest that indeed there was a significant sprain and possibly more than the soft tissues were affected. Usually, the ligaments provide stability to the joints, and when injured through a sprain, it can lead to feelings of instability - like something is \"shifting\" as you have described. This should improve over time with rest and physiotherapy. However, if not, or if your pain worsens dramatically, you should seek urgent medical attention.\n\nIt's strongly advised that you see an orthopedic specialist for a further evaluation. This will likely involve physical examination and potentially imaging studies like an X-ray or MRI which would help identify any damage to the bone, cartilage or ligaments in detail. \n\nIn the meantime, continue to rest the ankle, ice it, keep it elevated, and use compression (like an ACE bandage). Avoid putting weight on it and try not to play sports until you're properly evaluated as this may aggravate the injury. \n\nPain management with Advil (as long as you are adhering to the recommended dosage) is fine and will help reduce inflammation, just ensure you take it after food to prevent stomach issues.\n"}

The symptoms sound like you may have tinnitus, which is the perception of noise or ringing in the ears when there's no external source of the sound. It can occur after a head injury and it's often associated with hearing loss.\n\nWhile standard imaging tests might not catch it, specially tailored audiological assessments can be helpful here. \n\nYour description also suggests that the impact might have caused some type of damage to your auditory pathway, even if it was not visible on the CT scan or MRI. Unfortunately, such injuries can sometimes lead to persistent post-concussive symptoms involving headaches and sleep disturbances.\n\nThe good news is that while tinnitus cannot be completely cured in most cases, its effects can be managed successfully. Treatment options generally aim at creating a better quality of life by helping you manage your response to the sound, providing counselling, cognitive behavioural therapy, and medications where warranted. Other treatments include hearing aids if there is associated hearing loss, sound generators, and certain types of neuromodulation therapies.\n\nMake sure you are being managed by practitioners who specialize in these distressing post-traumatic symptoms such as ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialists and audiology experts for your tinnitus, neurologists for your headaches and possibly psychologist/psychiatrist for cognitive behavioral therapy for your sleep disturbances.\n\nRemember to always seek help when necessary and keep open communication with your healthcare provider about any changes in your symptoms.\n\nIt would also be important to review"}

If it appears not sufficient in managing your pain, you could consider contacting your dentist for alternative medication or different dosage instructions.\n\nYour usage of Chlorhexamed forte (which contains the active ingredient chlorhexidine) is also helpful, as it is often used as an adjunctive treatment for oral infections due to its antimicrobial properties.\n\nIf after 3-4 days of starting antibiotics there's absolutely no improvement, or if your condition seems to be worsening (increasing pain, swelling or fever), then a revisit to your dentist would be advisable to reassess and possibly adjust your treatment.\n\nRemember to maintain good oral hygiene practices. Rinse your mouth with warm salt water 3-4 times a day - this can help remove any debris and promote healing. Try to eat soft foods, and avoid smoking and alcohol which can delay healing."}

Then I ejaculated on her butt and then I wiped off the sperm with a towel. Is there a chance of pregnancy? If some drops of semen had fallen by chance on her outer vagina and due to fingering also? Her periods were finished on 16th and we had this on 18th and today is 19th. Do I need to give her a pill or not? Kindly help.", "output": "While the risk would be considered fairly low, it's important to note that there is always a small chance of pregnancy whenever sperm comes into contact with the female genital region. Pre-ejaculate (the fluid that sometimes comes out before ejaculation) can on rare occasions contain some sperm, and if any semen did come into contact with her vagina, there could be a minimal risk. As she was just off her period, she is unlikely to be in her most fertile window, but this also varies greatly between women.\n\nIf you're concerned about potential pregnancy, emergency contraception (like Plan B or ellaOne) may be an option since it can be effective if taken within 72 hours (3 days) after unprotected sex. Ultimately, whether she takes emergency contraception should be her decision, so I encourage both of you to have a thoughtful conversation about this scenario and its potential consequences.\n\nIn the future, for peace of mind and better protection against unplanned pregnancies, consider using a reliable form of contraception."}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hi doctor,I am suffering from white tiny particles on penis skin and itching forehead skin. What is the cause? What is the solution? I am currently applying Candid B.", "output": "The presence of white tiny particles on your penis skin could be indicative of several possible conditions, including a yeast infection (candidiasis), balanitis which is inflammation of the glans, or public lice. Symptoms like dew drops on a spider web, severe itching, tiny eggs attached to hair shafts etc are more suggestive of pubic lice.\n\nThe itching on your forehead may not necessarily relate with the penile condition unless there's some underlying generalized skin condition. It could be due to dermatitis, eczema or allergies among other things. \n\nWhile Candid B has an antifungal and a mild steroid, it may not always work if the diagnosis isn't candida. Please consult a healthcare professional/dermatologist who can examine you and confirm the diagnosis before starting any treatment as wrong treatment can potentially worsen your symptoms or lead to unnecessary side effects.\n\nMeanwhile, maintain good personal hygiene, avoid scratching the area hard, wear loose cotton underwear and refrain from sexual activities till cleared by the doctor."}

Can I increase it to 6 inches because I think that nothing is impossible? Is there any way? I also suffered erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation. The sex time is only one minute.", "output": "It's important to remember that the size of your penis does not equate to satisfaction in a sexual relationship and normal penis sizes can vary greatly. The average erect penis size is around 5 inches, so you are not far off from average, but it's crucial to understand that everyone is different.\n\nIn terms of increasing penis size, there are many proposed methods out there (e.g., surgery, pills, ointments, stretching exercises), but none have been proven to be definitively effective long-term or without significant potential risks and complications. Moreover, many healthcare professionals would discourage any attempts at augmenting penis size for purely cosmetic reasons.\n\nAs for your issues with erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation, these are common problems that a lot of men face. In most cases, they are treatable. You could consider seeing a sexual health professional who may suggest behavioral techniques which help to delay ejaculation. These include the start-stop technique and the squeeze technique.\n\nPsychotherapy might also be helpful in addressing any anxiety, stress, or self-esteem issues that might be contributing to these problems. Medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are often used to treat premature ejaculation. Erectile dysfunction may also be effectively managed with lifestyle modifications, medications like PDE-5 inhibitors, sex therapy, and/or changes in certain health-related behaviors.\n\nRemember to maintain a healthy diet, stay well-hydrated, avoid smoking, get regular exercise, and monitor alcohol consumption, as these factors can impact"}

My friends advised me to apply Lignocaine Hydrochloride gel between his buttocks. By mistake, I applied more. I am very much worried. I hope it is not harmful. Please advice.", "output": "Lignocaine Hydrochloride is a local anesthetic that's commonly used to decrease pain or discomfort caused by minor skin irritations. However, it's not typically used for hard motions in children. If you applied too much, it could cause some side effects such as eye tearing, blurred vision, dizziness or tremors if it gets absorbed into bloodstream. In normal cases, these effects are rare.\n\nSince your son is only 2 years old, I don't recommend experimenting with creams or medications without direct guidance from his pediatrician. Hard stools or constipation in kids can usually be managed with dietary changes like more fluids and high-fiber foods, but you should definitely consult with his doctor about this issue.\n\nFor the circumcision site, clean water and diaper barrier cream to prevent rubbing against diapers are recommended for wound care unless told otherwise by the surgeon who performed the procedure. \n\nPlease keep observing him. If he shows any side effects, take him to his healthcare provider immediately. Even if there are no signs of reaction, please discuss what happened with his doctor at your earliest convenience.

Both operations can indeed be done at the same time and are often performed concurrently if both conditions are present.\n\nThe pain you have now could be due to a few different reasons:\n\n1. Nerve entrapment: Sometimes, nerves in the groin area can get entrapped during hernia repair leading to chronic pain.\n2. Hematoma / Seroma formation: Collection of blood or fluid near surgical site can lead to pressure symptoms and cause discomfort.\n3. Post-surgical infection: In some rare cases, infection might occur after surgery which can lead to severe pain.\n4. Prostatitis/ Epididymitis: These are inflammatory conditions of prostate and epididymis (tube in testis) respectively; which can mimic testicular or groin pain.\n5. Testicular torsion: This is very rare but it's an emergency condition where testicle gets twisted causing severe pain.\n\nGiven your reported level of discomfort and its impact on your life, I'd recommend that you reach out to your surgeon as soon as possible for an evaluation. If these post-operative complications are ruled out, they may refer you to a Pain Clinic to better manage your pain symptoms.

I have chronic constipation.", "output": "Colon cleansing, also known as colon therapy or colonic irrigation, refers to various treatments aimed at removing toxins from the colon and intestinal tract. Techniques for this can include taking supplements, adopting a special diet, or having a colonic, which involves flushing the colon with fluids.\n\nColonic hydrotherapy is one form of colon cleansing. In this process, warm filtered water is gently infused into the colon through the rectum to cleanse and hydrate the large intestine.\n\nHowever, there's substantial debate in the medical community regarding whether colon cleansing procedures are necessary or beneficial. The human body is designed to detoxify itself naturally, and there's limited evidence that these procedures offer any health benefits. On the contrary, they may even have risks such as dehydration, infection, bowel perforations, and disturbances in your electrolytes.\n\nRegarding chronic constipation, while a single colonic session may provide temporary relief, it\u2019s not a long-term solution and doesn't address the underlying causes of constipation, which often include diet, physical activity level, hydration status, and stress management habits.\n\nMoreover, regular use of colonics can disrupt the natural balance of bacteria in your digestive tract, reducing immunity and potentially leading to chronic health issues. \n\nBefore proceeding with colon hydrotherapy or similar treatments, you should speak with your healthcare provider for personalized advice.

Also, what should I do from this point onwards? Should I continue as normal or begin a new packet entirely?", "output": "Not taking oral contraceptive pills consistently and correctly increases the risk of pregnancy. The first week is especially important because it's the beginning of a new hormonal cycle - missing so many pills in this timeframe does increase your chance of getting pregnant if you have unprotected sex, as ovulation may not be suppressed.\n\nIn terms of what you should do now:\n\n1. It sounds like you've already resumed your normal pill regimen, which is good. Continue taking your birth control every day at the same time hereafter.\n2. If there's concern about potential exposure to pregnancy due to the missed pills followed by unprotected intercourse, it might be worthwhile considering emergency contraception (the \"morning after pill\") if it's within 72 hours of the intercourse. This can help prevent an undesired pregnancy. \n3. However, some types of emergency contraceptives are less effective in women who are overweight or obese.

Is it side effect of the pill or is it implantation bleeding? And when can she expect her normal periods?", "output": "The symptoms you described can occur after taking the morning-after pill (emergency contraception, like I-pill). These pills work by preventing ovulation and may affect the uterine lining which can potentially lead to spotting or an irregular period.\n\nMild cramps and spotting that she is experiencing now could be side reactions from taking the morning after pill. This kind of discharge, typically called breakthrough bleeding, can both be a common side effect of emergency contraceptive pills and are usually nothing to worry about. \n\nRemember that implantation bleeding is not experienced by all women and it is generally lighter, lasts less time, and occurs earlier than typical menstrual bleeding. It's difficult to definitively distinguish between these based on your descriptions alone.\n\nIt's worth noting that although I-pill is quite effective if taken within 72 hours, no contraceptive methods are 100% effective, so there is always a chance of pregnancy following unprotected intercourse.\n\nAs for her periods, emergency contraception can sometimes cause changes in the menstrual cycle, making the next period come either later or earlier, or making the period lighter, heavier, longer or more painful.\n\nIf she misses her period beyond one week or has other reasons to believe she might be pregnant (like increased frequency of urination, tender breasts, nausea), then I would recommend taking a home pregnancy test to rule out any potential pregnancies.\n\nAlso, if the spotting continues or the pain worsens, it is important to seek medical attention immediately as these could be signs of an ectopic pregnancy, which calls"}

Valproic acid has been shown to help control seizures in many patients, and starting therapy after a first seizure may reduce the chance of future episodes. However, given that your son's EEG and MRI are normal, this suggests that there might not be an ongoing or underlying condition causing the seizures.\n\nThe decision on when to start medication after a single seizure varies case by case and depends on several factors such as how easily controlled the seizures are, potential side effects of the medications, the risk of another seizure and how it would impact your son's life. \n\nThere's no one-size-fits-all answer here and both options have their merits: watching and waiting can eliminate the need for unnecessary medication if the seizure was a one-time event, while beginning treatment could potentially control seizures before they become a recurring issue.\n\nClose follow-up with his neurologist/pediatrician is very necessary.

If I rotate my knees back and hips forward, I can do more stretch, but there is also a slight stop. What is this and can it be worked? Will stretching help to release that stopping pain or am I anatomically incapable of doing a middle split? There is pain only when I am doing a center split. How to fix it? I do a lot of kicking, and I do not want to injure myself.", "output": "The symptoms you described could be attributed to multiple conditions such as tendinitis, bursitis, a labral tear, or hip impingement. However, it's difficult to provide an exact diagnosis without an in-person evaluation. Stretching may help if the pain is due to tight muscles, but if there's an underlying injury, stretching might exacerbate the problem.\n\nIn general, not everyone anatomically can achieve every type of split. Hip structure varies among individuals and some simply don't have the anatomy that allows for certain actual positions.\n\nPhysics also plays a role here. In right/left splits, your body weight helps push you down into the stretch. But in a straddle/center split, gravity isn't helping much, as it\u2019s pulling you downwards rather than sideways, hence, the sense of restriction or stopping feeling.\n\nMy suggestion would be to do gentle stretches for all parts of your hip and leg muscles (not just your adductors) before doing any splits. Strengthening the surrounding muscles will also help. If these solutions don\u2019t bring about improvement, consider consulting with a physical therapist who can evaluate your specific situation more closely.\n\nAlso, remember if pain persists during certain activities, it is crucial not to ignore it so as not to cause further damage.

I took Regestrone to delay my periods because I planned to get intimate the same day as my periods. I took them for three to four days before my expected period date and had the tablet two to three times a day. Last dose I had it just the night before having sex. I had sex many times the next night but with protection and took an i-pill to be sure. Next week got light periods that were very painful. But ignored it thinking it was because of hormonal imbalance. Both of us were affected by flu and it turned into a stomach infection with alternate periods of diarrhea and constipation that was accompanied with mild nausea but had no vomiting. I became very weak and then eventually recovered by taking Pantocid, Digene and Zandu pancharishta. I am six days overdue and had slight back pain, nausea and increased urination. I do have migraine issues as well as I am quite obese with a BMI of 33.8. I got two home pregnancy tests done and both of them turned out to be negative. However, I still have not got my periods yet and I have been insisted to check for PCOS and get an ultrasound done. I am worried if the ultrasound shows that I am pregnant. I have gained about 4 kg. Is it possible to get a false negative six weeks after having sex? What can I do to get my periods early? Please advice.", "output": "From what you've explained, it sounds like there could be multiple factors contributing to your period delay. It's important to understand that having sex for the first time, using hormonal tablets like Regestrone and i-pill, dealing with an infection as well as stress, can all disrupt your menstrual cycle. As you are obese, this can also affect hormone levels and normal menstruation.\n\nAccording to research, home pregnancy tests are about 99% accurate when taken correctly, and false negatives are very rare especially six weeks after intercourse so it is highly unlikely that you may have had a false negative result twice if followed instructions properly. But there is still a very small chance, so if you are really concerned, you could see a healthcare provider and discuss the possibility of taking a blood test, which offers higher accuracy. \n\nFor PCOS diagnosis, an ultrasound is one of the methods. However, it\u2019s also possible to diagnose based on other symptoms or blood tests, and the ultrasound finding would just confirm the clinical suspicion. If you do have PCOS, weight reduction, diet changes, and sometimes hormonal therapy under guidance can help regulate your periods.\n\nIn terms of inducing your period earlier, unless absolutely necessary, it's better to let your body get back into its rhythm naturally. However, if you have any further doubts, do not hesitate to consult your gynecologist for proper evaluation."}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,Should I get a permanent retainer months after braces and use of a removable retainer? Part of my overbite has returned since I got my braces off due to tongue thrusting. Partly because I never wore my retainers as much as I should have. Can I get a permanent retainer at this point? Or is it too late?", "output": "Yes, you can consider getting a permanent retainer even months after your braces have been removed. However, it's important to review this decision with your orthodontist first. Permanent retainers can be great for maintaining tooth alignment because they take the responsibility of remembering to wear your removable retainer out of your hands. \n\nBut remember, permanent retainers do not prevent changes in bite or the return of an overbite due to tongue thrusting. They mainly keep teeth in place. You might need additional treatment like tongue thrust therapy or other specific interventions depending on the severity of your condition.\n\nSo I would strongly recommend booking an appointment with your orthodontist who can evaluate your current situation and advise you accordingly."}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,After having intercourse with my husband, I had taken Unwanted 72 within 12 hours of intercourse. But, I missed my periods and got pregnant. Now, my question is will this ECP damage the fetus in any way? I also want to let you know that six months back, I had an abortion as my child was very low. Kindly suggest me, is it safe to continue my pregnancy with all these problems?", "output": "Emergency Contraceptive Pills (ECP) like Unwanted 72 are meant to prevent pregnancy, not end an ongoing pregnancy. There's currently no evidence that ECPs harm a developing fetus if they're unsuccessful in preventing a pregnancy. That being said, data on the impact of such pills on an ongoing pregnancy is limited.\n\nPrevious abortions typically don't lead to problems with future pregnancies unless there were complications during or after the procedure. However, it would be important to discuss with your obstetrician about your previous abortion for further evaluations.\n\nThe decision to continue with your current pregnancy involves considering several factors--the health of both you and the fetus, as well as social, psychological and financial readiness. Consultation with your doctor should help you make this decision. \n\nI'd recommend you get prenatal care as soon as possible to manage any risks. If you decide to proceed with the pregnancy, regular check-ups and ultrasounds will help monitor the development and health of your fetus."}

I have been having puffed up nipples since long and can feel slight hardness under the nipple surface. It is painless and there is no discharge. I suspect gynecomastia. I can provide you photographs. Need your advice on treatment.", "output": "Your symptoms do sound consistent with gynecomastia, which is enlargement or swelling of breast tissue in males. Gynecomastia can be caused by an imbalance of hormones - estrogen and testosterone. A variety of medical conditions, medications (like steroids, anti-anxiety drugs, antibiotics), use of recreational drugs and alcohol can also cause it.\n\nAs per ethical guidelines, I won't be able to view your photographs, but I suggest you book a physical consultation with a doctor who can examine you properly. \n\nIn terms of treatment options, they largely depend on the underlying cause:\n\n1. If gynecomastia is due to certain medications or substances, discontinuation should solve the problem. Of course, discuss this first with your physician - don't stop prescribed meds without their approval.\n2. If it's due to hormone fluctuation during puberty or aging process, it can go away on its own within six months to two years.\n3. If a known medical condition is causing it, treating that will often resolve the issue.\n4. In cases where it does not resolve spontaneously or if the cause cannot be addressed directly, treatment may involve medication or even surgical intervention like liposuction or mastectomy.\n\nRemember, only a diagnosis from a trained professional can confirm your suspicions and point you towards appropriate treatment. Be sure to schedule an appointment and discuss your concerns."}

Center of the eye is paining with irritation.", "output": "Your symptoms such as a red, painful eye with sensitivity to light and pain on moving the eyeball might suggest a condition called uveitis. This is an inflammation of the middle layer of the eye which includes the iris (colored part of the eye) and adjacent tissue, known collectively as the uvea.\n\nHowever, these symptoms could also be related to other eye conditions such as conjunctivitis or glaucoma. It's very important that you seek immediate medical attention as some of these conditions can lead to permanent vision loss if not promptly treated. An ophthalmologist will use special instruments to examine your eye thoroughly and determine the cause of your symptoms. Please remember it's inappropriate and unsafe to self-diagnose or delay seeking professional help in this case.\n\nFor temporary relief, avoid bright lights and use sunglasses.

Could this be the reason I have premature ejaculation? At times, I also have a weak erection after one ejaculation. What should I take to treat these? Thanks.", "output": "Premature ejaculation can have various causes. Although low testosterone levels might be a factor in premature ejaculation, your level seems to be within normal range if we assume 4.459 nmol/L (however it would still depend on the reference range used by the lab you used).\n\nA condition called erectile dysfunction could be contributing to your weak erections, which may also relate to your transmitter level and hormonal profile that you mentioned. Other factors include psychological stress, excessive alcohol consumption, smoking, and underlying medical conditions like diabetes or heart disease.\n\nTaking supplements to address vitamin deficiencies would be necessary, given that vitamins E, K and C play crucial roles in overall health, including reproductive and sexual health. However, they should be complemented with a balanced diet and healthy lifestyle habits.\n\nTreatments for premature ejaculation and weak erections involve behavioral techniques, topical anesthetics, medications, and counseling. Medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors are generally prescribed. But every treatment has its pros and cons and must be tailored according to individual requirement.\n\nHowever, I would strongly recommend discussing these results with your primary doctor or consulting a urologist or sex therapist, who will understand your case better and give the appropriate advice and treatment. Attempting self-medication without proper guidance may do more harm than good."}

You might have caused irritation or an infection by trying to treat the wart yourself, which could explain why it's swollen and discolored. \n\nFor future reference, over-the-counter treatments containing salicylic acid are typically recommended for treating warts. However, if these don't work or if your wart becomes painful, starts bleeding, or changes in appearance, it's important to seek medical attention.\n\nAs of now, please keep the area clean and try not to touch or pick at the wart too much to avoid spreading it. Consult with a healthcare provider and they can provide treatments like cryotherapy (freezing), minor surgery, or prescription creams.\n  \nRemember, online advice is not a substitute for a clinical examination.

{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,My wife was pregnant last year, but a miscarriage occurred. We consulted our gynecologist and he suggested we have a TORCH test. The result of TORCH was rubella IgG 270.30 and IgM 0.42, and CMV IgG 118.60 and IgM 0.26. We are unable to understand the report. Is this hike in the value of Rubella IgG and CMV IgG the cause of miscarriage? Please guide us.", "output": "I'm sorry to hear that you've gone through this difficult time. The TORCH test checks for infections in the body. \n\nThe rubella IgG test being positive (270.30) means that your wife has been exposed to, and created antibodies to fight off rubella virus at some point in her life. It does not necessarily mean a recent infection as these antibodies can stay in the body for a long-time after an infection is completely resolved.\n\nA negative rubella IgM result (0.42) typically suggests that she most likely did not have a recent rubella infection. This is because IgM refers to the type of antibodies produced immediately when the body encounters a new infection.\n\nSimilarly, the high CMV IgG value (118.60) signifies past exposure to cytomegalovirus and antibody development by the immune system. A low or negative CMV IgM level (0.26) indicates no recent infection.\n\nSo, the high Rubella IgG and CMV IgG levels indicate previous rather than active infections. They do not necessarily indicate the cause of the miscarriage. Miscarriages can be caused by various factors such as chromosomal abnormalities, certain medical conditions in the mother, lifestyle factors etc. It would be best if you continue working with your doctor or a fertility specialist for further investigation into the cause and future prevention of miscarriages.\n"}

The part that came off was very thin but I am worried my tooth could become more sensitive and more could break off so I would really like to fix this in some way. What is the best way to go about this?", "output": "You should definitely see a dentist to have this examined. It sounds like you may need dental bonding or a dental crown, depending on the size of the chip and the extent of damage to the tooth. The chipped tooth is noticeably more sensitive because the enamel, which protects against variations in temperatures, has been damaged.\n\nMeanwhile, avoid eating hard food with the affected tooth; try not to consume very hot or cold foods/drinks if it gives too much sensitivity. Over-the-counter pain relievers can be used for temporary relief but using them for a long period of time isn't recommended without consulting with a healthcare professional. \n\nRemember it's better to get it treated sooner than later to prevent further complications.                       \n"}

When in doubt, you should always seek care from a healthcare professional.\n\nBased on your daughter's history, she has eczema followed by hypopigmented patches and your doctors are considering vitiligo. Tacrolimus is used as a second-line treatment for moderate to severe eczema when other treatments have not worked well enough.

Your use of a nebulizer is a good step, however instead of normal saline, asthma usually needs to be treated with bronchodilators (like albuterol) or corticosteroids which relax and open up the airways. These medications are often prescribed by a doctor.\n\nIt's also quite important that you consult with a pediatrician if your son's coughing continues despite using the nebulizer. The coughing spells during the night could indicate poor control of his asthma symptoms, and his treatment may need adjustments. Frequent medication reviews are essential for anyone with asthma, especially children given their varying growth rates and changing environments (e.g school, sports, etc). \n\nNonetheless, continue ensuring he avoids triggers such as allergens, infections, exercise, changes in weather, and others that could potentially worsen his asthma.\n\nRemember, this advice is based on the limited information provided and you should urgently take him for a proper medical evaluation."}

However, overconsumption of protein can affect people differently. Some people might develop kidney stones, others might experience digestive problems; while some symptoms might not be directly related to protein toxicity at all.\n\nYour description suggests that your high consumption of protein shakes in the past might have disrupted your body's metabolic balance. Despite this situation being quite rare, high intakes of protein in short periods might put stress on liver and kidneys, resulting in increased synthesis of urea or even nephrolithiasis (kidney stones). Symptoms like pain around the kidney area, dizziness and pulsation sensation could potentially relate to those conditions. \n\nKeep in mind though, that nutrient imbalance regarding other minerals and vitamins is also possible when consuming large amounts of single-nutrient products like protein powder.\n\nYou're right in thinking a toxicologist may help if this is indeed due to protein toxicity - but often this will be ruled out by a thorough medical assessment first by a primary care doctor who might redirect you to other specialists such as a nephrologist (kidney specialist) or a neurologist depending on the symptoms. \n\nIn terms of immediate steps and medications: do continue keeping yourself well hydrated as this can help protect your kidneys.

I had a scan at 6 weeks 3 days approx. and fetus measuring around 5 mm with HR of 120, was told its good and measured 6 weeks. Do I still have a chance at a normal pregnancy or will I miscarry due to hCG not doubling as they should?", "output": "While it's true that in early pregnancy, hCG normally doubles every 48 to 72 hours, once the levels reach about 6,000 mIU/ml, the doubling time slows down and can even take 4 days. Don't focus exclusively on the numbers. A normal rise in hCG may not necessarily indicate a healthy pregnancy, and a lower rise does not automatically mean a problem \u2013 there is a wide range of normal hCG levels.\n\nThe fetal heart rate of 120 beats per minute at around 6 weeks is within the normal range, which is usually anywhere from 90-110 bpm at 5-6 weeks and for 6-7 weeks could be anywhere between 110 and 130 bpm. Also, the fetus measuring 5 mm at approximately 6 weeks 3 days seems good.\n\nIt's understandable if you're feeling anxious about these results, but it's best to discuss your concerns with your doctor who will interpret your lab results according to specific details about your health status and history.

Endometriosis is a disease in which tissue similar to the lining inside the uterus (called \u201cthe endometrium\u201d), is found outside the uterus, where it induces a chronic inflammatory reaction that may result in scar tissue. It's common among women in their 30s and 40s but can occur at any age. Symptoms vary, some women have no symptoms at all, whereas others might have severe pain and heavy bleeding.\n\nOther possibilities could include uterine fibroids or polyps, both of which are non-cancerous growths that can cause heavy bleeding and pain. Pelvic inflammatory disease could also cause this symptom, although you said you tested negative for STDs, still, it can sometimes occur due to normal bacteria in your vagina.\n\nIt is very important that you seek out medical attention to receive an accurate diagnosis. Always make sure to tell your healthcare provider about all of your symptoms so they can choose the most appropriate diagnostic tests. This will likely involve a pelvic exam and possibly imaging studies like ultrasound or MRI. In some cases, a surgical procedure like a laparoscopy might even be necessary for a definitive diagnosis.

However, whether a type II (Galassi) arachnoid cyst located on the left temporal lobe can cause psychiatric symptoms, such as mood fluctuations, depression and panic attacks, is still controversial in scientific literature. \n\nIn some cases, research has shown that cysts like this situated near areas of the brain involved in emotion regulation (like the temporal lobes) could, theoretically, interfere with these functions and result in relevant symptoms. However, other studies have found no strong association between arachnoid cysts and psychiatric disorders.\n\nWhat seems to be agreed upon by most researchers is that when an arachnoid cyst causes symptoms due to its size, location, or the pressure it places on nearby structures, it's primarily neurological symptoms - like headaches, seizures, focal neurological deficits, etc.\n\nDepression, anxiety, and panic attacks can be influenced by numerous factors, including recent life stressors like you've mentioned\u2014losing a father and changes in your life.\n\nMild pain associated with increased heart rate may not necessarily be related to the cyst but should be evaluated nonetheless.\n\nYou're already under treatment for your concerns, which is good.

Though typically not harmful and seen as normal with ageing, a sudden increase in floaters, especially if accompanied by light flashes or peripheral vision loss, could indicate a retinal detachment which is medical emergency.\n\nHowever, since the floater you've described seems more significant than usual to you, it would also be prudent to have this checked out by an optometrist or ophthalmologist to ensure there isn't a problem such as Retinal Detachment, Optic Neuritis, Macular Hole, etc. It's important not to panic though, as it very well may be benign, but only a professional will be able to give a proper assessment.\n\nPlease seek immediate medial care for vision changes."}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hi doctor,Can the adult palate narrow or change shape due to age or stress or hormonal factors?", "output": "The shape of the adult palate is generally considered to be quite stable and does not typically change due to aging, stress or hormonal factors. Once an individual has reached full maturity, their skeletal structure, including the jaw and palate, usually remains relatively consistent unless impacted by trauma, disease such as cancer or specific conditions that affect bone density such as osteoporosis.\n\nHowever, what can affect the perception of changes in oral cavity or palate could actually be other factors. For example, loss of teeth without proper prosthetic replacement can lead to bone resorption over time, changing the feel and function within the mouth. Oral diseases, mucosal issues and temporomandibular disorders (issues with the jaw joint) could potentially give a feeling of change or narrowing in the oral cavity. Problems with your sinuses and allergies can also cause discomfort and even facial changes if they lead to chronic inflammation.\n\nFurthermore, chronic stress can theoretically influence oral health indirectly through neglect of hygiene, poor diet or parafunctional habits like teeth grinding which may over time contribute to changes in the mouth environment but it wouldn't directly change or narrow the palate itself.\n\nIf you are experiencing any discomfort, changes in speech, eating or breathing, make sure you discuss these with your healthcare provider to rule out serious conditions and find the appropriate treatment.

It works by using ultrasound waves to create pictures of the heart and its functioning. This allows doctors to observe the size and shape of your heart and its chambers, measure how well your heart is functioning and pumping blood, identify areas of poor blood flow and heart muscle that's not contracting normally, as well as problems with the valves. \n\nHowever, for restrictive cardiomyopathy, your doctor may have difficulty distinguishing it from constrictive pericarditis on an echocardiogram. He or she might need to use additional imaging tests such as cardiac MRI or CT scan.\n\nElectrocardiogram (ECG) is also useful in diagnosing this condition but not specific. The ECG shows abnormal heart rhythms, which are often seen in people with restrictive cardiomyopathy.\n\nPremature ventricular contractions could be associated with various cardiac conditions, not specifically restrictive cardiomyopathy.

Typically, its use in dental procedures such as a sinus lift graft and implant placement is to prevent any possible infection post-procedure.\n\nThe dose and duration seem about right for such a procedure. Still, depending on your body weight, overall health condition and susceptibility to infections, the prescriptions can vary. This is only from a general perspective, and specific clinical cases may require different approaches.\n\nConcerning interactions between Levofloxacin, ibuprofen and Dexamethasone, it's true that there is some potential for interaction but not significant enough to cause concern in most cases. However, since Levofloxacin may increase the risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture, concurrent administration of corticosteroids like dexamethasone can potentially exacerbate this risk.\n\nLevofloxacin does have side effects, with a small percentage of patients experiencing more severe reactions. All antibiotics can potentially be toxic if taken incorrectly or if the patient has an unusual reaction, but they are generally safe when used as directed by a healthcare professional.\n\nGiven your concerns, I'd advise discussing them further with your dentist. They are familiar with your specific situation and would be best suited to address your questions comprehensively. You have every right to understand why certain medications are being recommended for you and what risks they pose.\n\nIf the concern persists or if you experience any unexpected symptoms,"}

What shall I do next?", "output": "If your doctor prescribed Medroxyprogesterone and you still haven't started your period after the medication course, I'd recommend contacting your healthcare provider to discuss this. It's possible that it may take a few more days for your period to start, but it's important to update them about your situation. If you have Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), this condition can cause irregular menstruation or even lack of menstruation among other symptoms. There are numerous treatments for PCOS including lifestyle changes, medication, and potentially hormone therapy. Each individual is different so a treatment plan would be tailored around your specific medical history, needs, and goals. The best thing for now is to get in touch with your doctor for further evaluation and advice."}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hi doctor,I have a sore throat for the past 15 days. I tried taking all the medicines. But there is no use. I had also done four tests for HIV in this period. I had protected sex. All the results came negative. Why do I have a sore throat? If I am doing another HIV test, do I need to test with the morning blood?", "output": "Sore throat has many potential causes, including viral infections like the common cold, bacterial infections like strep throat, smoking or exposure to smoke, allergies, and dry air. It's unlikely that your condition is related to HIV especially with your recent protected sexual encounter and multiple negative test results.\n\nIf you've had a persistent sore throat for over two weeks, it could be a sign of a more serious issue. I would recommend seeing an otolaryngologist (an Ear, Nose, Throat doctor) who can perform a detailed evaluation and possibly determine the cause of your persistent sore throat. \n\nAs for your question regarding the timing of the blood draw for HIV tests, there is no specific time that is deemed optimal or necessary for sampling. The important thing is not the time when the sample is taken but the window period: the time between potential exposure to HIV infection and the point when the test will give an accurate result. Most HIV tests are highly accurate after a 4-6 week window period from the time of potential exposure.\n\nContinuous testing might not help here as you have already performed four tests which came back negative in this timeframe. Instead, focus on figuring out other possible causes for your symptoms.\n"}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hi doctor, I am taking rabies vaccination. Right now I have completed two doses of my injection. My question is if I get another bite during my vaccination do I have to restart my rabies course from starting or should I continue the same course?", "output": "No, you don't need to restart the series if you're bitten again. However, you should definitely visit your healthcare provider immediately after any potential exposure to rabies, even if you are in the process of vaccine administration. They would assess the situation and might decide to continue with the schedule or administer additional doses depending on your risk level. Post-exposure prophylaxis may also be recommended which consists of one dose of immune globulin and four doses of rabies vaccine given over a 14-day period. So, while it might not be starting over, there might be additional treatment needed. Always consult your health care provider in these situations."}

At times, I have itchy runny eyes. My doctor has prescribed an ointment Otocomb which sometimes help. In the past few months, I have noticed a sore in my inside of the left nostril. It feels like it runs neatly along the rise or cartilage. It sometimes forms a scab that I pick at. I am worried that it is not improving.", "output": "From your description, it sounds like you could be suffering from something called allergic rhinitis which is an overactive immune response to allergens in the air such as dust, pet dander or pollen. The symptoms often include a runny nose, post-nasal drip and itchy eyes among others.\n\nThe nosebleeds can occur due to the constant irritation from blowing or rubbing your nose frequently. Blood-streaked nasal discharge indicates trauma to small blood vessels, most commonly from repeated nose-blowing.\n\nThe sore inside your nostril that appears to have formed a scab could also be related to this but might also be due to dryness, especially if you're in a cold climate or using indoor heating which reduces humidity and tends to dry out the nostrils. Repeatedly scratching or picking at this area could make the damage worse and prolong healing time.\n\nHowever, it's also worth noting that any persistent unhealed sore should warrant further evaluation. If the sore has been there for more than 2-3 weeks, I would recommend seeing an ENT specialist to inspect it and rule out other potential causes, particularly since you describe it forming along the cartilage of your nose.\n\nTreatment options for allergic rhinitis include antihistamine medication (either oral or nasal spray), corticosteroid nasal sprays, decongestants, and allergy shots. Some of these require prescriptions so it would be best to discuss with your healthcare provider what option would be best for you"}

How do you recommend I get rid of them? Should I consult my dentist? Should I continue using my whitening pen? Of note, I am currently on Guanfacine.", "output": "It's important to note that as an AI trained to assist, I will provide advice based on the information you've given.\n\nWhite spots on teeth after using a whitening product could either be due to uneven bleaching\u2014where some areas of your teeth respond better to the bleach than others\u2014or they might indicate areas of decalcification or early cavities. Bleaching products can make these spots more noticeable.\n\nRegarding your question about allergies, white spots are not typically associated with allergic reactions. Typical allergic reactions would present symptoms like rash, difficulty breathing, or swelling in the mouth or throat.\n\nFor your situation, it is recommended that you stop using the whitening pen for now and arrange an appointment with your dentist. They can examine your teeth and advise whether the white spots are due to uneven bleaching or underlying dental issues.\n\nOver-the-counter whiteners are generally safe; however, at your age (13), tooth development is still ongoing, and exposing developing teeth too frequently to bleaching agents may cause sensitivity and damage. It is also important to highlight that any kind of medicine or medical treatment should be used under the major's supervision if you are underage.\n\nGuanfacine usage is unrelated to this issue. However, do mention it to your dentist because it's always good to keep all your healthcare providers informed about what medications you're taking."}

Should I go through with the laminectomy, or should I deal with the back pain since I have built a high tolerance for pain and can do most (but not all) activities?", "output": "This is a complex decision and ultimately one that you have to make, as it's related to your quality of life. Since you've tried non-surgical treatments without significant improvement, surgery may be the next reasonable step. Laminectomy has been shown to significantly reduce pain and improve quality of life in people with spinal stenosis.\n\nHowever, like all surgeries, it does come with risks and potential complications such as infection, nerve damage, and even worsening symptoms. A conversation about these risks and benefits should absolutely be had in detail with your surgeon before making a definitive decision. In some cases, the relief provided by laminectomy might be temporary as other parts of the spine can degenerate over time.\n\nAlso, consider whether or not there are any less invasive surgical options available for you. Newer technologies and techniques sometimes offer similar benefits to traditional procedures but with smaller incisions, potentially less overall risk, and possibly faster recovery times.\n\nIt sounds like currently your level of activity is restricted to some extent due to your back and leg symptoms, and if it\u2019s affecting your daily life/activities, then you might want to consider the surgical option seriously.\n\nRemember, it's okay to get a second opinion - seeking input from another specialist might provide more information or alternative options that could inform your decision.\n\nImportantly, discuss this fully with the healthcare professionals involved in your care and ensure all your concerns and questions are addressed before you make a final decision.

Then I have done two subsequent D dimer tests, and both the ranges were elevated. The values are 521 ng/mL and 707 ng/mL. I am taking tablet Armour for hypothyroidism and a multivitamin tablet.", "output": "Elevated D-dimer levels can be indicative of thrombosis (blood clots), but also various other conditions, since it is a general marker for increased activity in the body's clotting system. Given that your CT scan did not show a clot and you have continued to have elevated D-dimer values, it would suggest something else could be causing these readings.\n\nSome possible reasons for sustained elevated D-Dimer levels may include recent surgery or injury, pregnancy, malignancy (cancer), infections, liver disease, some inflammatory conditions and even older age. \n\nSince you are on Armour thyroid medication, I assume you have hypothyroidism. There has been some evidence suggesting subclinical hypothyroidism might contribute to hypercoagulable states, which could possibly explain an elevation in D-dimer. However, this is still somewhat speculative and more research needs to be done in the field.\n\nIn summary, while high D-dimer levels can help suggest the diagnosis of blood clots, the lack of conclusive imaging evidence along with ongoing elevated levels means we probably need to look deeper into what else might be going on. Consideration should be given to testing for alternative diagnoses such as malignancies, liver diseases, infections and other inflammatory conditions (if they weren't already ruled out).

You should consider visiting a healthcare professional for further evaluation.\n\nIf it's a UTI, your health care provider may prescribe antibiotics such as Nitrofurantoin (Macrobid) or Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim). Over-the-counter products such as Azo can assist in relieving some of the symptoms but will not cure a UTI. Remember, it is always imperative that you finish the full course of any prescribed antibiotics even if your symptoms improve before the medication is finished.\n\nHowever, these recommendations are just general advice and might not be appropriate depending on your overall health condition. Therefore I suggest seeing a medical professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment regime.\n  \nAlso, staying hydrated and urinating before and after sexual intercourse could help prevent future UTIs."}

I would appreciate talking to someone because I am terrified.", "output": "I understand your concerns and it's natural to be worried about unusual symptoms. However, abnormal bleeding alone does not necessarily indicate cancer and is relatively common. There are many possible reasons for irregular vaginal bleeding like stress, sudden weight loss/gain or heavy exercising.\n\nBut let's consider some more details: Given that you've mentioned an erythrocyte value of 25 in your urinalysis report, it seems there could be potential blood in the urine too. This may or may not be relevant to your bleeding episodes but needs further investigation. \n\nRegarding your ferritin level, it's at the low end (generally, a ferritin level below 30 is considered as deficiency), so it might indicate iron deficiency anemia, especially if you're having excessive bleeding. Your eGFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate) rate is within normal range which suggests good kidney function. As for leukocyte esterase showing up at 0.3mg/L, this typically indicates inflammation somewhere in the body, potentially a urinary tract infection (UTI).\n\nIn summary, gynecological cancers are unlikely to be the first cause suspected with these types of symptoms, especially since all your hormone levels, including thyroid and pituitary gland, have returned normal.

Please help with your reply, and I am getting stressed.", "output": "Firstly, I understand your fear and anxiety about these symptoms. The risk of HIV transmission is significantly reduced when a condom is used consistently and correctly during sex.\n\nTo answer your questions,\n\n1. From your description, it would seem that actual penetration did not occur after the condom slipped, which makes the possibility of transmission relatively low. If there was no penile-vaginal contact and no exchange of bodily fluids such as semen or vaginal fluid, then the probability of contracting an STI or HIV is very slim to none.\n\n2. The p24 tests you conducted are highly accurate in detecting early stages of HIV infection. In general, guidelines suggest confirmatory test at 12 weeks after potential exposure because this window period gives time for detectable antibodies to form if the virus is present. However, do remember that two negative results are definitely reassuring.\n\n3. Swollen lymph nodes can be caused due to several reasons other than HIV infection like bacterial infections, viral infections, etc. Therefore, it'd be premature to assume any serious condition just based on this symptom.\n\nNonetheless, getting yourself tested at 12 weeks would give you a definitive conclusion regarding your status. And also, consider visiting your healthcare provider regarding your swollen lymph nodes. They can diagnose the cause and treat it accordingly.

Can I take an antibiotic to clear the infection?", "output": "Yes, antibiotics can often be used to clear an infection in your tooth and gums especially if you have signs of severe infection like swelling or fevers. However, it's important to seek a dental professional's opinion because the underlying issue causing the infection, such as tooth decay or gum disease, must also be addressed. Antibiotics without appropriate dental treatment will only provide temporary relief. They won't permanently fix any underlying dental issues causing the infection. Therefore, make sure to consult with your dentist who might prescribe you an antibiotic like Amoxicillin, Metronidazole or others suitable for your condition."}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,How can I figure out my conception date? My last menstrual period was three months back. I had my dating ultrasound and it put the GA at 9 weeks and 3 days. Also there was a CRL measurement of 26.96. My due date based on LMP and ultrasound are different. Please answer. Also how many \"safe\" days are there after a period?", "output": "To determine the estimated date of conception, you typically start from your last menstrual period (LMP). Pregnancy is counted as being 40 weeks long, so your LMP day is considered the first day of your pregnancy. However, bear in mind you likely conceived sometime in the second week after your LMP.\n\nAn ultrasound can provide a more accurate estimation of gestational age. In your case, if your ultrasound put gestational age at 9 weeks and 3 days, you would count back 7 weeks and 4 days (subtract 2 weeks to account for pre-ovulation) from the day the ultrasound was performed to estimate your conception date. If your dates based on LMP and ultrasound are different, it's not unusual. The accuracy of an ultrasound decreases as pregnancy progresses, but early ultrasounds are usually very precise.\n\nRegarding your question about \"safe\" days after a period: Assuming an average 28-day cycle with ovulation around day 14 and the fact that sperm can survive up to five days within female reproductive tract, most likely \"safe\" days are often deemed to be the few days directly following menstruation. But remember that this highly depends on individual variations in menstrual cycles and is not a certain method of birth control. Each woman is unique in her fertility patterns and thus it may vary.\n\nIt's always best to talk to your healthcare provider about any questions or concerns you may have regarding conception dates or safe periods. They will be able to give you the most"}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,I got my periods today for the second time in 10 days. The last time I got it, there was less flow comparatively. On 30th, I had unprotected sex and had an I-pill immediately. Can you please tell me if there is anything harmful?", "output": "Irregular bleeding can happen after taking emergency contraception, such as the I-pill. The I-pill can cause your next period to come early or late, and the flow may be lighter or heavier than usual. This should return to normal by itself with your next cycle.\n\nHowever, frequent or continual bleeding could also indicate other problems like hormonal imbalance, stress, polyps, fibroids, or infection among other things. If this continues, it's best you see a gynaecologist for a check-up.\n\nAlso, remember that emergency contraception is not meant to be a regular method of birth control; frequent use can cause menstrual irregularities and other side effects. It's better to use regular contraception consistently if you're sexually active and do not want to get pregnant. Regular sexually transmitted infections (STIs) testing is essential too because emergency contraceptive pills will not protect against STIs."}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,I am a 36 year old male and my wife is 28 years old. I have been suffering from azoospermia and have been in touch with different doctors for the last eight to 10 months. I have done many tests and everyone is ending up with a suggestion of testicular biopsy. My wife is not in favor of this and both of us would like to go for other tests before going for a biopsy. I am attaching all the reports. Can you please let me know whether there is any hope of the sperm coming back?  Please suggest. I had four cycles of chemotherapy six years back and now I am completely cured.", "output": "Without being able to review the actual test results, I can only provide some general advice. Azoospermia is a condition which leads to there being no measurable sperm concentration in your semen. It can be due to non-obstructive causes (issues with sperm production) or obstructive causes (problems transporting/sending out the sperm). \n\nYour history of chemotherapy is significant; this could have caused damage to the cells responsible for producing sperm, leading to nonobstructive azoospermia. Still, in some cases, sperm production can recover many years after chemotherapy. If hormone tests show normal FSH and testosterone levels, recovery may eventually occur.\n\nBefore heading towards biopsy, another option could be hormonal treatment to boost sperm production. The idea is that stimulating certain hormones might motivate the remaining active sperm-producing cells. Another method to retrieve sperm would be via micro-TESE (Testicular Sperm Extraction), where under microscope direct extraction of sperm is attempted from the testes.\n\nProceeding forward, I would suggest both you and your wife to consult with your fertility doctor or your urologist to understand all possible options, potential benefits, risks, as well as any other further invasive or non-invasive methods available. Always remember, consulting a mental health or supportive care services during this period can also be beneficial for both of you as it's a challenging time."}

As an AI, I do not have personal experience but anesthesiologists typically require 12-14 years of education and training after high school.\n2. The frequency varies greatly depending on the size and focus of the hospital. Some anesthesiologists might never administer anesthesia during labor if they specialize elsewhere.\n3. Epidural analgesia is most often used for pregnant women in labor, which falls under the category of regional anesthesia (RA).\n4. Yes, certain anesthetic agents can cross the placental barrier from mother to child.\n5. The nature and extent of this transfer depend on the specific drug's properties. Most anesthetics are designed to minimize potential harm.\n6. This again depends on the specific practice and specialization of the anesthesiologist. Pediatric anesthesiologists may do this more frequently.\n7. General Anesthesia (GA) is most commonly used for infants during surgery.\n8. Propofol is common for induction while sevoflurane or desflurane can be used for maintenance.

I have no fever, shortness of breath or any other symptoms to speak of. I have set an appointment with infectious disease specialist by next week. As the wound got healed, could it still be in my blood? Do I need to do anything before my visit? Should I push to be seen earlier?", "output": "Nocardia is a bacterium that can cause skin and lung infections, especially in people with weakened immune systems. Nocardia infections require specific antibiotics for treatment, often over a long period of time (weeks to months) because this type of bacteria tends to form abscesses.\n\nBecause these infections are usually slow-growing, they do not typically progress rapidly. Therefore, it may be unlikely that the infection has spread to your blood or other parts of your body especially given that you've noticed improvement with wound healing. It also sounds like you're feeling generally well without any symptoms like fever or breathlessness which are signs of systemic involvement.\n\nHowever, considering a positive culture result, it's recommended you keep your appointment with the infectious disease specialist as planned. They have expertise in managing conditions such as nocardiosis and will advise on appropriate investigations such as repeat cultures, blood tests or imaging studies if needed, and also guide about the need and duration of antibiotic therapy.\n\nUntil your visit, make sure to closely monitor any changes in your health status \u2013 particularly fever, increasing fatigue, cough, pain at the site of healed wound or any new lesions, and seek immediate care should those arise. Also, continue good personal hygiene practices to prevent further spread or exposure- washing hands regularly, avoid scratching, rubbing the scarred area to minimise re-infection risks.\n\nRemember, while awaiting professional advice, always reach out early for help if anything concerning arises! \n\nPlease know that this advice is for general informational purposes and a"}

I had a concussion when I was 17 and spent a day in the hospital.My MRI brain is obviously abnormal with white matter. What is the likelihood of MS? I had an MRI in 2015 and said chronic microvascular changes. MRI of a couple of weeks ago said no tumor on auditory nerves. Please explain.", "output": "I understand your concern. From the information provided, it seems like you have a few signs that can be indicative of multiple sclerosis (MS), such as the presence of white matter on your brain MRI, tingling in your toe and a history of concussion.\n\nHowever, the diagnosis of MS requires certain criteria to be met, including evidence of damage in at least two separate areas of the central nervous system, which must have occurred at different points in time. Your symptom of unilateral tinnitus correlates more commonly with issues related to ear health rather than MS. \n\nAlso, the moderate to severe stenosis in your spine could be causing the minor tingling sensation you are experiencing in your toe. Spinal stenosis is a narrowing of the spaces within your spine which can put pressure on the nerves that pass through the spine, often leading to symptoms such as tingling or numbness in a foot or leg.\n\nChronic microvascular changes on your MRI typically indicate small blood vessel disease, which is common in people who have high blood pressure, diabetes, or aging-related conditions like dementia. Its mention in regards to your scan from 2015 should be considered alongside other health factors and age.\n\nGiven all this information, while it's possible for these things to correlate with MS, they also correlate well with other explanations so it wouldn't necessarily mean you have MS. I highly recommend continuing your conversations with your neurologist, but you might want to consider seeking a second opinion if you remain concerned. Again,"}

My doctors are clueless and I am desperate. I hope you may have some suggestions.Symptoms:Persistent unbearable fatigue which is worst in the morning and afternoon, worsens after eating a meal, after standing up and after drinking coffee. It gets better after lying down with legs raised and after stretching the neck and after drinking alcohol. Otherwise the fatigue prevents me from doing most normal daily activities. I can barely sit and watch videos, eat and use the toilet. I am not able to do any other work. While sitting I fall asleep during the daytime.Resting and intention tremor (while rotating the wrists).Sluggish memory, fairly frequent memory lapses (forgetting my friends names). Clumsiness - when pressing buttons on the computer or microwave I often miss the button and while opening drawers or doors I grasp air instead of the handle, etc.Eye coordination problems - while reading my eyes jump over words thereby making me misread words for something else or just omit words.Cognitive difficulty - with mental arithmetics and planning and I often mispronounce words or use different words than the appropriate one in a sentence during speech.Post-void urinary dribbling and frequent defecation.Flashes of past memory like dreams while awake, euphoria turning into nausea and extreme tiredness afterwards.Pain in the neck, muscle cramps and stiffness in the neck and TMJ area. (I have had orthodontic treatment for the past 2.5 years for correcting underbite). Slightly dislocated coccyx.Pain and pressure behind the eyes, urge to blink often.Tests done and reports:MRI scan of the brain: normal.Thyroid function tests, Liver Function Tests (LFT), serum electrolytes, vitamin B12, kidney function tests: normal.Glucose blood test: normal.Lyme disease: no abnormalities.Gluten intolerance: no abnormalities.Complete Blood Count: no abnormalities.Urine microscopy: no abnormalities.Psychiatrist: no abnormalities, except worry about my health.No hypotension or orthostatic hypotension.Sleep study: no hypoxia or sleep apnea.No papilledema and nystagmus.Plantar reflex - flexion, negative Romberg\\s sign.Symmetrical reflexes.No family history of any disease, no childhood history, no epilepsy, no drugs ever taken.Serum C-reactive protein level, serum vitamin B12, serum ACE level, serum folate, complement C3, complement C4, ESR (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate) are within normal range.Could all of these be caused by anxiety disorder/ depression?What all tests would you recommend to rule out all possible underlying neurological conditions? What is the most probable condition I am suffering from?", "output": "Your symptoms are quite complex and are affecting various systems of your body. While it is possible that some or all of these could be psychosomatic, meaning they arise from mental or emotional stress, there does seem to be a possibility of an underlying condition based on the persistence and severity you've described.\n\nOne condition which matches some of your symptoms is Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), also known as Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME). CFS/ME involves extreme fatigue that can't be explained by any underlying medical condition, along with other symptoms like cognitive difficulties, memory problems, muscle and joint pain and post-exertional malaise. A tilt table test can be used to help with this diagnosis.\n\nAnother condition to consider might be Fibromyalgia, as it shares many symptoms with CFS including fatigue, cognitive difficulties, and muscular pain and stiffness. Your doctors may want to look at results from a tender point exam, though FM diagnosis often relies heavily on symptom presentation rather than testing.\n\nGiven the memory lapse and cognitive issues, neurological conditions such as Multiple Sclerosis should be ruled out as well. This would require additional imaging such as MRI of the spine and tests like lumbar puncture and evoked potentials studies.\n\nEye coordination problems points towards a possible issue with your nervous system, so I recommend consulting with a neurologist and having a detailed eye examination done by an ophthalmologist. The Post-void urinary dribbling suggests a possible urological problem,"}

However, I strongly recommend you get in touch with a healthcare provider who can physically examine you and maybe order further tests or scans for an accurate diagnosis. Light pain in the left abdominal area especially needs to be investigated further as it could signify a problem with the organs present there such as the lower end of the colon. This isn't meant to alarm you but to emphasize that proper medical evaluation is important."}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,My husband and I will be using a surrogate to have kids. My husband is kell positive (heterozygous). What are the risks to this that the surrogate would need to be aware of?", "output": "While a Kell antigen positive father does not have any direct health implications for the surrogate, there may be risks for the baby if the surrogate is Kell antigen negative. In a scenario where mother (or surrogate) is Kell negative and father is Kell positive, there is a chance that during pregnancy the baby might inherit the Kell positive status from the father.\n\nThis could potentially become a problem if the surrogate's immune system mounts an immune response to these antigens and creates antibodies against them, recognizing them as foreign substances since she is Kell negative. This usually doesn't happen during a first pregnancy but may occur in subsequent pregnancies or if there was a previous blood transfusion with Kell-positive blood.\n\nThe produced antibodies can cross the placenta and attack the baby's red blood cells, leading to a condition known as Hemolytic Disease of the Newborn (HDN). HDN can vary from mild to severe, causing conditions like jaundice, anemia, heart failure, or even stillbirth in extreme cases.\n\nSo, if your husband is Kell positive and the surrogate is Kell negative, it would need careful monitoring by their healthcare provider throughout the pregnancy. Rhesus compatibility will also be considered in the conjunction with Kell antigen, so RhD negative women should ideally only carry a RhD negative embryo in surrogacy or at least the surrogate should be given Anti-D prophylaxis.

Small chromosomal anomalies and small clonal population may not be detected using the standard methods employed. Could you please explain what does it mean? What can be done for her? Will she be able to have kids?", "output": "The karyotype you provided, 46,XY, typically indicates the genetic makeup of a male. This suggests your sister might have a condition called Swyer Syndrome or XY gonadal dysgenesis. In this condition, individuals are genetically male but phenotypically (i.e., as per their body characteristics) female. \n\nPlease note this is an interpretation and it's important that you follow up with a professional that specializes in genetics or a reproductive endocrinologist.\n\nIn terms of treatment options \u2013 hormone replacement therapy can be initiated to begin menstrual periods and development of secondary sexual characteristics such as breast development. She will need regular check-ups because there's a risk of developing cancerous cells in her internal testes, so they may need to be surgically removed.\n\nRegarding fertility, even if she takes hormone replacements, your sister may not be able to conceive using her own eggs, as she won't usually have functioning ovaries. However, it is possible for women with Swyer syndrome to carry a pregnancy if they receive donated eggs via in vitro fertilization (IVF).\n\nThis information can be overwhelming, so it's important to approach specialists who can provide detailed explanations and support.\n"}

I still have low energy, and it is affecting my daily life. Can I take an infusion now? Can it help me? Please suggest.", "output": "Your ferritin levels indeed indicate iron deficiency. Iron deficiency can cause symptoms such as fatigue or lack of energy, shortness of breath, and paleness. It's important to understand that iron is a key component in the production of our red blood cells, which carry oxygen throughout our body.\n\nGiven that you are symptomatic and your ferritin levels have only marginally improved despite oral supplements, intravenous iron infusion might be a good option for you. It has the potential to increase your iron levels more quickly and efficiently than oral supplements. \n\nHowever, I must emphasize that it's essential to liaise closely with your healthcare provider or hematologist about this decision. Iron infusions can have side effects and may not be appropriate for everyone.\n\nFurthermore, remember it takes time after any iron therapy (oral or infused), to get back into your normal routine and regain your strength. Allow your body time to create new healthy red blood cells using the additional iron you've acquired - this process commonly takes several weeks.\n\nFinally, the source of your iron deficiency must also be addressed. Iron deficiency could stem from several causes including poor absorption, chronic bleeding, or an inadequate diet. I'd advise discussing these possibilities as well with your healthcare provider."}

Temporary tooth sensitivity following a dental procedure is common, particularly in response to cold foods and beverages. It may take several weeks for your tooth to fully settle down. In the interim, you could try using a desensitizing toothpaste which can help with the pain. Avoiding extremely hot or cold food/drinks can also minimize sensitivity. If discomfort persists beyond two weeks or worsens suddenly, I would recommend visiting your dentist again as they might need to adjust the filling.

When can I expect my next period (on the date or delayed)?", "output": "Emergency contraception like the Ipill is not 100% effective, but it works a majority of the time when taken properly. It reduces your risk of getting pregnant from unprotected sex (which includes potential exposure to pre-cum) by about 85%-90%, especially if you take it within 72 hours.\n\nThe brown discharge could be due to the effects of the pill (it can cause changes in menstrual cycle and spotting or breakthrough bleeding), or other factors related to hormonal fluctuations. Too frequent use of emergency contraception can disrupt your menstrual cycle causing symptoms such as irregular periods, spotting, cramps etc., which might be what you're experiencing.\n\nUsually, after using an emergency contraceptive, you should get your period roughly at the expected time\u2014give or take a week. \n\nHowever, if you don't have a period within three weeks of taking the pill, or if you have any other concerns like severe cramping, pain, heavy bleeding, or signs that could suggest pregnancy (nausea, breast tenderness, increased urination), it's important to take a home pregnancy test and/or consult with a healthcare provider immediately.\n  \nRemember, regular use of a prescribed form of birth control is much more effective than using emergency contraception on a regular basis.

Irregularities in menstrual periods can be due to various reasons apart from pregnancy such as stress, being overweight or underweight, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), conditions affecting the thyroid gland, or premature menopause among others.\n\nWhat you experienced could potentially be a chemical pregnancy, which is an early miscarriage that happens within the first few weeks of a pregnancy, often before a woman even knows she's pregnant. It might not show on an ultrasound yet still cause a positive pregnancy test result since it does trigger the production of hCG hormones, but these levels would drop rapidly afterward and turn into a negative result later when checked again.\n\nHowever, it is also possible that you\u2019re dealing with an underlying condition that needs medical attention. Conditions like PCOS or thyroid disorders can disrupt hormonal balance, leading to irregular or missed periods.\n\nGiven your situation, I strongly recommend visiting your healthcare provider for more comprehensive investigation.

I am a bit confused, whether should I totally stop Metformin and start with these new drugs?", "output": "It's understandable that all these changes in medication would cause confusion and concern. Each doctor has their own approach to treating conditions like PCOS, based on their clinical experience, latest research, and patient's individual condition.\n\nSpeaking generally, metformin is often used in PCOS to improve insulin resistance, while Myo-inositol (APCOD sachet's major component) also performs a similar function and some studies suggest that it could perform even better in this aspect. The transition might have been intended to address the issue from a different pathway or because you may not responding as expected to metformin. \n\nSafegest D contains dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), which can be useful for improving ovulatory function and egg quality in women with PCOS.\n\nAdova, containing anastrozole, is an aromatase inhibitor, and is used to stimulate ovulation sometimes instead of Clomid. Your new doctor might think it will work better given your history.\n\nHowever, it's very important not to change your medical regimen without thoroughly discussing concerns with your doctors.

Testosterone replacement therapy can also contribute to increased PSA levels. However, it'll be prudent and considered good medical practice to monitor the successive levels closely, especially if testosterone therapy is continuing, as there could be possible effects on prostate health.\n\nDiscuss this concern with your urologist. Depending on your age, family history, and other risk factors of prostate disease or cancer, your doctor may recommend certain steps (further testing like free PSA test, prostate ultrasound scan, MRI, or even biopsy in some cases).\n\nRemember, while PSA is often used to screen for prostate cancer, higher results do not automatically suggest you have cancer. It just pinpoints the need for further examination. Always pay attention to your urinary symptoms-if any and report them.\n  \nHowever, one should remember that online advice cannot replace a real-life consultation with your practitioner who has your entire medical history and clinical condition at hand. Make sure you set up an appointment with your doctor to discuss the PSA values."}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,My A1c is 5.4 and my fasting glucose is 107 and I was taking 800 mg of Seroquel which is a medication for paranoid schizophrenia and is known for causing diabetes and high blood sugar and five minutes after taking a 400 mg pill, one day my sugar went over 200 and the next day five minutes after taking a 400 mg pill, my sugar went up to 495. So, I stopped the Seroquel. According to my A1c, I am a nondiabetic, according to my fasting glucose, I am a pre-diabetic, and according to those two high blood sugar readings, I am a serious diabetic. Those are three different diagnoses. But those two high readings could have just been because of the Seroquel because I have never had high readings like that other than when I was taking the Seroquel and I was taking a high dose. A lot of people only take 100 to 200 mg, but I was taking 800 mg. So, do you think I am a diabetic or do you think it was just the Seroquel that caused the two high readings?", "output": "Based on the information provided, it's possible that Seroquel (Quetiapine) might have contributed to the high glucose readings as it is known to affect blood sugar levels. Your A1C level is within the normal range (below 5.7%) which usually implies non-diabetic status. However, your fasting glucose at 107 falls into the pre-diabetes category (100-125). \n    \nWhile these two isolated incidents of very high blood sugar do raise concerns, they may also be anomalous due to the likely influence of such a high dose of Seroquel. \n\nThat being said, consistent monitoring and further testing are necessary to rule out diabetes. I suggest speaking with your primary care physician about conducting more thorough assessments like repeated fasting glucose tests, oral glucose tolerance tests and postprandial glucose checks. It would also be beneficial to discuss alternate medication for schizophrenia that might have less impact on your blood sugar level.\n\nRemember, only a comprehensive evaluation by a healthcare provider can provide a definitive diagnosis. So, this advice should serve as informational guidance pending professional medical advice.\n"}

My symptoms are fatigue, pins, and needles in hands and feet, slow cognition. Should I be receiving injections again?", "output": "Your symptoms could be related to a low B12 level. Although your recent blood test shows a result within the recommended range, it is on the lower end and may benefit from an increase. However, before making any decisions about recommencing injections, further evaluations should be made as these symptoms might also be due to another underlying cause.\n\nIt's possible that you are not fully absorbing the B12 from your supplement or diet. Some gastrointestinal conditions like celiac disease or certain medications can affect absorption. Moreover, your symptoms may be unrelated to B12 and could be indicative of other neurological or systemic issues.\n\nSo, please speak with your doctor about your continuing symptoms.

The problem I have is that I have to try quite hard to speak in a normal tone, and I am extremely self-conscious about the way I sound. I breathed through my mouth my entire life until I had a septoplasty three years back. Now I can breathe through one nostril, which I guess is 60 % open, while the other one is always 100 % blocked. What is happening, that is making me sound like this? I know I was not meant to sound this way, there has to be something causing some problem. Any idea or suggestion will be appreciated.", "output": "From your description, it seems like there might be a few issues at play here. First, the fact that you have difficulty breathing through one nostril despite having had septoplasty suggests some form of persistent nasal obstruction. This could be due to structural problems like a deviated nasal septum not fully corrected with surgery or other causes such as inflammation from allergies or chronic sinusitis.\n\nNasal congestion and mouth breathing can indeed affect voice quality by interfering with proper phonation and resonance. This can cause a nasally or muffled voice, which may explain why others perceive you to be \"mumbling\". \n\nHowever, poor voice projection or imprecise articulation can also be behaviors learned over time, like habits, that require conscious effort to change. \n\nIt's also worth noting that individual voice characteristics are influenced not only by physical factors such as vocal cord structure and function but also by psychological aspects including self-perception and anxiety about voice quality. It sounds like your self-consciousness about your voice might be contributing to this issue as well.\n\nMy recommendations:\n\n1. Consult an Ear Nose Throat (ENT) specialist for an examination of your nose and throat to look for any potential anatomical issues causing continued nasal obstruction.\n   \n2. Speech therapy might be beneficial for learning techniques to control your voice and improve clarity. A trained speech-language pathologist can evaluate your speaking style and suggest strategies to encourage better communication.\n\n3.

I have been jumping from one idea to another for a long time but it has been three years I have an issue with frequent urination. It started in a bad time for me when I was obsessing that I have HIV. No burning, just slight urethra burning. I went to a urologist. He told me nothing was wrong, maybe an overactive bladder. I go to the toilet every two hours or three. I never knew what was wrong, but I started to obsess over it and it got worse to a place that my mind is in urination 24/7. I almost gave up until I went on a vacation and during that vacation, I forgot about it totally. The frequency was gone and even the burning urethra. Also, I had to remove my wisdom teeth and when I did, I was so occupied thinking about it that I forgot about urination and I noticed that I do not use the bathroom like I used to. But, I got back obsessing about it again and it got to a point that I urinate a lot of high volumes every hour. It comes suddenly and goes on its own. I use to get those episodes every few months when I had stress but since I got the fear it might never go away I get it almost daily now. I do not know what to do. Can anxiety cause polyuria like this clear urine when I am stressed?", "output": "Yes, anxiety can sometimes cause increased frequency of urination. The body may respond to stress and anxiety by producing adrenaline, which could in turn stimulate bladder activity or increase the urge to urinate. So it's understandable that when you're focused on other things during vacations or after your surgery, you noticed an improvement in your symptoms. That being said, one should also rule out medical causes like diabetes, bladder problems, urinary tract infections, etc., even though you\u2019ve already consulted a urologist. It seems like practicing stress management techniques could be beneficial. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) specifically focuses on changing patterns of thinking and behavior, and might be helpful for managing your obsessive thoughts about urinating.

Often it's caused by psychological reasons such as anxiety or over-excitement. However, sometimes, it could also be due to physical conditions like hormonal imbalances, inflammation/infection of the prostate, abnormal reflex activity of the ejaculatory system, or certain genetic traits.\n\nInternet porn addiction can lead to performance anxiety and unrealistic expectations about sex which might be adding to your problem of premature ejaculation. It's great that you have identified this issue and are taking steps to deal with it but these changes may take time.\n\nThe difficulty to hold urine for a long time is typically not directly associated with premature ejaculation unless there's an underlying condition affecting the pelvic muscles or nerves responsible for bladder control.

These can be extremely painful and potentially dangerous if they cause blockages in your urinary tract.\n\nAs for treatment, it\u2019s important to consult with an urologist who might advise better methods suitable for your health condition. The type of anesthesia used depends on the procedure that will be carried out to remove or break down the stones - some procedures only require local anesthesia, while others may necessitate general anesthesia. \n\nDrinking plenty of water daily helps in flushing out smaller kidney stones. However, for more significant sized ones like yours (2 cm), usually, medical intervention is required. While some people believe lemon juice and olive oil may help dissolve smaller kidney stones, there isn't much scientific evidence to back this up. Your fear that natural remedies might interfere with the stent or move the stone is valid as any alternative therapies should be discussed with your healthcare provider first due to potential complications.\n\nThe fact you also have diabetes adds another layer of complexity to your treatment as diabetes can affect your body's ability to heal and respond to infection. Your medication regimen suggests you're being treated for not just diabetes, but also cardiovascular conditions which requires careful management.

Many absurd myths have been created to discourage its practice, but they have all been debunked by the medical community.\n\nPotential negative impacts from masturbation are usually tied to excessive practices. Masturbating can become an issue if it interferes with everyday life or activities, relationships, responsibilities, etc. If you are masturbating in a controlled manner that doesn\u2019t interfere with your day-to-day life, it will not affect your sexual life after marriage.\n\nAlso, masturbation does not lead directly to erectile dysfunction. Erectile dysfunction occurs when a man can't get or keep an erection firm enough for sexual intercourse. It's a complex process involving the brain, hormones, emotions, nerves, muscles, and blood vessels. Problems with any of these can block the normal functioning of the penis.\n\nHowever, anxiety caused by guilt or fear about masturbation could potentially cause problems with sexual function such as erectile dysfunction. So, if you do experience dysfunction, it might be useful to speak to a healthcare professional who can explore potential psychological factors.\n\nRemember, communication with your future partner regarding each other\u2019s needs and expectations about sex may also help alleviate concerns or misconceptions you may still hold."}

But if you find yourself overly worried, you should definitely discuss your concerns with your doctor. They can provide more tailored advice based on your complete medical history and possibly order tests, if necessary. Regular check-ups are encouraged due to your positive ANA and weakly positive Smith antibody presence which requires monitoring for autoimmune conditions.\n\nMeanwhile, continue taking the baby aspirin unless advised otherwise by your physician, as it helps reduce your risk of blood clots. Consider increasing your water intake too as chronic dehydration can affect various lab test results. \n\nIt's also important to return to your healthcare provider to evaluate these abnormalities.

While any change in formula could potentially cause temporary digestive upset as the baby's system gets used to the new formulation, persistent diarrhea might be indicative of an underlying problem such as food intolerance or infection. \n\nTeething may also be contributing to the diarrhea, as some babies produce more saliva when teething which can lead to looser stools.\n\nThe introduction of new foods, like oatmeal and banana puree, could also affect bowel movement regularity and consistency.\n\nGiven the situation, I would recommend doing the following:\n\n1. Monitor your baby's health closely: Keep track of his stools, his feeding patterns, and any signs of dehydration (fewer wet diapers, dry mouth, lethargic). \n2.

Regular Contraceptive Pill: These are oral contraceptive pills usually contained estrogen and progestin, the two main female hormones. They are taken daily at approximately the same time every day, regardless of sexual activity. They work primarily by preventing ovulation i.e., release of egg from ovaries for fertilization. They also make changes in cervical mucus making it difficult for sperm to get through to uterus and reach egg. Also, they thin the lining of uterus making implantation of a fertilized egg less likely. \n\n2. Emergency Contraceptive Pill (I-Pill or Morning After Pill): The I-pill is intended for emergency use, to be used within 72 hours (the sooner, the better) after unprotected sex or contraceptive failure (like a condom break). This pill contains high levels of levonorgestrel, a type of progestin. It works primarily by stopping the release of an egg from the ovary. It may also work by preventing fertilization of an egg or preventing attachment of a fertilized egg to the uterus. \n\nIf you had unprotected sex and want to avoid pregnancy, you should take an emergency contraceptive pill like I-pill as soon as possible but not later than 72 hours after the intercourse.

I tried a couple of ointments, did not work. Cortisone helped a little, but not really. I think I need oral back up, any suggestions?", "output": "Hello there, it's unfortunate to hear about your situation. The acne on your back may also be due to hormonal changes, stress or certain types of medication you might be taking. In terms of oral medications, antibiotics (like tetracycline) can sometimes be used in more severe cases. However, Accutane (isotretinoin) is a powerful drug that's reserved for hard-to-treat cystic acne.\n\nIt's critical though to remember that self-prescribing medications could bring other risks and complications. To ensure the appropriate treatment, I'd strongly recommend that you consult a dermatologist who can properly assess your condition and prescribe the most suitable treatment tailored directly to your needs. Depending upon your exact condition, the doctor may also consider non-drug therapies like light therapy or some specific procedures performed under professional supervision.\n\nRemember to follow good hygiene practices (showering immediately after exercise, not wearing tight fitting clothes all day), maintain a balanced diet and stay hydrated \u2014 these habits would help improve your overall skin health. \n\nPlease schedule an appointment with a dermatologist as soon as possible."}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,55 years old male with complaint of ptosis on the right eye having diabetes for the past 10 to 12 years. FBS yesterday taken was 165 mg/dl. Ocular movement normal on left side but adduction limited in affected side. He is suspected to have third nerve palsy. What all medical intervention can be possible to get normal?", "output": "The management of third nerve palsy involves several steps and can depend on the underlying cause, which in this case could be related to your diabetes. Glycemic control is essential, so ensuring that your blood sugar levels are well-managed is a crucial first step - an FBS of 165 mg/dl indicates poor control so intensive glycemic control would need to be implemented.\n\nNext, steroids could be considered if there's severe inflammation around the affected nerves. If it's the result of a compressive lesion, such as an aneurysm or tumor, then surgical intervention may be required. In some cases, where recovery is not complete, corrective surgery for the ptosis or use of prisms in glasses for diplopia might be necessary to help alleviate symptoms.\n\nPhysical therapy has also been shown to be beneficial for some patients with acquired ptosis and strabismus. In physical therapy, you will learn exercises intended to strengthen your eyelid muscles and improve control over your eye movements.\n\nPlease consult an experienced ophthalmologist who can evaluate your condition better and decide the appropriate course of action based on your clinical condition and cause of the palsy. It should be noted that all treatments must be under regular medical supervision."}

This is not typically caused by drinking ice water, but instead from a viral infection. You might find relief with over-the-counter cold medications \u2013 please follow the instructions on the label when taking these medications. Resting and drinking plenty of fluids can also help.\n\nIf symptoms persist for more than a week or are severe (such as high fever, difficulty breathing, or persistent vomiting), please don't delay to contact your local healthcare provider immediately. Please remember that it's important not to self-medicate thoroughly without consulting a healthcare professional if symptoms continue or get worse.\n\nPlease note this advice should be used as general guidance and it is always best to consult with your healthcare professional for accurate information."}

I am using Emolene moisturizer and Neutrogena sun block which works well on my skin. I am using Vichy cream at night. Should I include anything more to get even skin? What facial can I go for? Please help.", "output": "Based on your description, firstly, let me commend you for taking such good care of your skin already. Addressing the pigmentation first, I would recommend a cream containing hydroquinone or retinoids since these are effective in lightening dark spots. However, they should be used under medical supervision due to potential side effects.\n\nFor wrinkles around your eyes, eye creams rich in Hyaluronic Acid, Peptides, and Retinol can help minimize their appearance. An example is RoC Retinol Correxion Anti-Aging Eye Cream.\n\nGiven that you have sensitive skin, it's important to choose products labeled as 'hypoallergenic'. For dry sensitive skin, Aveeno Skin Relief Moisture Repair Cream may serve as a good body lotion. It contains colloidal oatmeal which is known to soothe and restore moisture barrier for extremely dry skin.\n\nAlong with this routine, exfoliation once a week can provide improved skin texture and even out skin tone. But always use a gentle scrub considering your sensitive skin.\n\nAlso, visiting your dermatologist regularly can help you maintain skin health. They may suggest treatments like Microdermabrasion or Chemical peels which could help improve both pigmentation and wrinkling issues.\n\nLastly, always remember that sun protection is crucial. Continue using an SPF of at least 30, and wear hats and sunglasses whenever possible to protect your skin from UV radiation which can cause aging and further discoloration.

{"instruction": "", "input": "Hi, I have gradually developed unilateral ptosis, is there any cream or non surgical way to cure it. My eyes were fine till about a year ago, gradually my right eyelid started to droop and is getting worse day by day.", "output": "Unilateral ptosis, or drooping of one eyelid, can have several different potential causes including nerve disorders, muscular conditions, and age-related changes. Before discussing treatments, you should first obtain a diagnosis to understand the underlying cause.\n\nMost commonly, the cause is either a weakening of the muscles responsible for raising the eyelid (age-related), an issue with the nerve pathways that control eyelid movement (neurogenic ptosis), or a localized problem such as a benign cyst or tumor putting pressure on the lid (mechanical ptosis).\n\nAs to your question regarding non-surgical interventions, currently there are no creams or medications that effectively treat ptosis. Certain eye drops containing an alpha agonist can provide a temporary lift to the eyelid but their effectiveness varies from patient to patient and they only offer an ephemeral solution.\n\nIn most cases, especially if the ptosis is affecting your vision or quality of life, surgery to repair the levator muscle is usually the preferred treatment. Nonetheless, please consult with an ophthalmologist who can help determine the best course of action based on your specific situation and health. \n\nLastly remember that sudden onset or worsening condition can be a sign of something more serious like Horner's syndrome, Myasthenia Gravis, or even a stroke, so it is important to seek immediate medical attention if this is the case.\n"}

Is this normal? I had a previous root canal done to some other tooth, which got infected. Finally, I got pulled it out.", "output": "Sensitivity to hot food and liquids can often occur after getting a filling, particularly if the decay in the tooth was deep or close to the nerve (known as the pulp of the tooth). If the sensitivity continues after a couple weeks, it may mean that the damage to the tooth is more extensive than initially thought, and the nerve may be affected. Unfortunately, this sometimes results in needing root canal treatment.\n\nA root canal treatment is usually recommended when there's an infection that has reached deep into the tooth, causing inflammation or disease in the pulp. This procedure removes the infected material, alleviates pain and saves your tooth. However, like all medical procedures, it's not without risk. There are rare occasions where complications happen, such as reinfection which may lead to tooth extraction, as you experienced before. \n\nIn conclusion, while your circumstances aren't necessarily common, they're within the scope of normal potential outcomes when dealing with deep cavities. It is important to follow your dental professional's advice. Maintaining proper oral hygiene and regular dental check-ups can help prevent similar issues in future."}

I am attaching my prescription for your reference.", "output": "As an AI, I'm unable to directly view physical prescriptions or documents. However, based on the information provided it seems that your ophthalmologist suggested a two-step treatment: LASIK to correct your vision and squint correction surgery for exotropia.\n\nComing to what you've shared about your condition:\n1. Blurry near and distant vision - This can be due to refractive errors in the eye which LASIK will aim to correct.\n2. Exotropia squint - It's a form of strabismus where one or both of the eyes turn outward. This usually requires surgical intervention if it is causing significant symptoms or complications such as decreased vision (amblyopia) or disfigurement.\n\nYour ophthalmologist's suggestion seems appropriate; first correcting the vision with LASIK then treating the exotropia would typically give better overall results. However, these are not without their risks and potential side effects.\n\nIf you're unsure, do not hesitate to get a second opinion from another ophthalmologist \u2013 it's important that you'll feel confident and fully informed before deciding on a treatment option."}

Rest of the tests including thyroid, liver function tests, ECG, and lipid profile seem to be normal. Is this a cause for concern?", "output": "High ESR values can indicate an ongoing inflammatory process in the body. Similar symptoms could be related to several diseases and conditions: infection, autoimmune diseases, cancer.\n\nWhile it is unusual for the monocyte count to be zero in a complete blood count test, this alone does not usually signify a specific disease or condition. The monocytes are a type of white blood cell that fight certain types of infections and help other white blood cells remove dead or damaged tissues, destroy cancer cells, and regulate immunity against foreign substances.\n\nYour wife's symptoms, along with increased ESR and low monocyte count, could possibly suggest some form of systemic issue such as ongoing inflammation or infection, among others. However, please note that her current state could also due to recent illness (like she had a mild cough).\n\nA more thorough evaluation of your wife's health status may be necessary. Follow-up testing might be recommended to further investigate these findings. It's important to consult with the healthcare provider who ordered her tests to discuss what these results may mean for your wife's health.\n\nRemember that while these tests provide important clues, they aren't definitive. They need to be interpreted considering all aspects of your wife's health, including her symptoms, her past medical history, etc. So the best step would be contacting her primary healthcare provider for a detailed discussion."}

So, I should replace the cap. Now just two weeks back, I replaced but now I have a bulge in the jaw with pain.", "output": "It's important you reach out to your dentist promptly, they know the specifics of your treatment. The bulge in the jaw along with pain can be due to a few things:\n\n1. An infection: Even after root canal therapy, occasionally residual bacteria can lead to reinfection, leading to painful swelling.\n\n2. Abscess: If an abscess has formed at the end of your root canal-treated tooth, it might cause swelling and discomfort. \n\n3. Improper fit or bite alignment of the new cap : This could potentially irritate the surrounding tissue causing discomfort and swelling\n\n4. Trauma: During the replacement of the cap if the tissues got traumatized, it could have resulted in a hematoma (swelling composed of clotted blood)\n\n5. Allergic reaction: Although rare, it could also be possible that you're having an allergic reaction to the zirconia. \n\nIn conclusion, it's very important that you go back to your dentist as soon as you can. They will probably take a radiograph to check for any signs of infection at the apex of your tooth's root to ascertain the next steps. For temporary relief from the pain, over-the-counter analgesics such as paracetamol (acetaminophen) or ibuprofen can be used \u2013 but should not replace the need for prompt evaluation by a healthcare professional.\n"}

A few weeks ago, something triggered my mind, and I was harming one of my child in my mind. After that, my thoughts got escalated, and it became like a daily thing. I am unable to forget these thoughts. My doctor prescribed me Zoloft 25 mg for anxiety, and I started taking it. Will Zoloft help me to come out from these thoughts?", "output": "Zoloft is prescribed to treat a variety of conditions, including depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder, and anxiety disorders. It belongs to a class of drugs known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). It works by increasing the amount of serotonin, a natural substance in the brain that helps maintain mental balance.\n\nRegarding intrusive thoughts about harming your child, these can be a sign of harm OCD, a subtype of OCD characterized by having intense, recurrent, and persistent thoughts or images about causing harm to oneself or others. However, I strongly advise you to consult with a psychiatrist or psychologist for proper diagnosis and treatment. Remember that people with harm OCD do not want to hurt anyone; they are usually distressed by these thoughts.\n\nIt's important to note that while Zoloft may help manage symptoms related to such intrusive thoughts, therapy is often considered the first-line treatment for this type of problem. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), specifically Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) has been shown to be very effective. \n\nIn conclusion, Zoloft alone may not eliminate these thoughts completely but it can help lower your overall anxiety and make it easier for you to engage in beneficial behavioral therapies.

There is a substantial body of research pointing to the fact that children raised in same-sex households fare just as well as those in heterosexual households when it comes to mental health and overall wellbeing.\n\nSuicide, depression, obesity or substance dependency are major issues that can affect any individual or family, regardless of parental sexual orientation. They are influenced by various factors such as genetics, environment, social situations and many more complex variables tied to individual experiences.\n\nThat said, in all families it's key that they foster loving and supportive environments for their children, educating them about healthy habits, good mental health practices, and resilience against adversity. If you're concerned, perhaps you could encourage the new parents to provide these positive influences, just like in any other family. \n\nFinally, if there are specific signs or symptoms of distress in the child, then it would be appropriate to seek professional help from psychologists, therapists or pediatricians who specialize in child developmental care.

While in hospital, she contracted C.diff and has had several recurring bouts with it. She has had a transplant and so far she is doing well with no recurrence. She also has a fistula near the rectum from an abscess. They put in a tube to keep it open and flowing. She has always had bouts of constipation and diarrhea for years before the accident. Her cognitive functions have been diminishing. One of my brothers is living with her and care taking her for full time.She is very weak, but can walk with the aid of a walker. Before the accident, she was fine. But, she may have shown a few signs of slight memory issues and balance prior to the accident as well. Our main issue right now is loose stools with some fecal incontinence. The doctor said that the fecal incontinence is because of a weak rectum that will not hold back fecal matter. Also, the fistula is always draining. When her stools are normal, she has good energy and cognitive function. When she has loose stools, she is very weak and can hardly stand or walk. Her cognitive function is a lot worse. She gets very confused about daily items and memory issues.We are looking for supplements to keep her regular and avoid the loose stool episodes.

However, several steps could potentially help:\n\n1. Diet modification: You've already started limiting dairy, sugar and carbohydrates which is good. Continue with this and consider introducing more soluble fiber. Foods rich in soluble fibers slow down the digestive process and can provide bulk to the stool, like bananas, rice, oatmeal and applesauce.\n\n2. Probiotics: They can be beneficial for her gut health, especially since she had a history of C.diff infection. Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species are commonly used and can be found in some yogurts or as a supplement.\n\n3. Medication adjustment: Some medications can cause loose stools. It might be helpful to review all her medication with her primary care doctor to see if any changes can be made.\n\n4. Hydrate properly: Ensure she's drinking enough fluids. When we have loose stools, our body loses water which can lead to dehydration - this worsens weakness and fatigue.\n   \nFor energy improvement:\n\nConsider incorporating gentle forms of exercise into her daily routine. Walking (with assistance) could gradually improve her strength and endurance.\n\nSupplements may also help. Coenzyme Q10 is one supplement that has been associated with improved energy levels. A dietitian can help establish an eating plan that supports energy levels.

It's when your skin produces more melanin in response to inflammation, which results in dark spots where the pimples used to be. Here are steps you can follow:\n\n1. Start by avoiding sun exposure as much as possible because the ultraviolet rays increase melanin production which can darken the spots.\n2. Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher every day, regardless of the weather. This not only prevents the dark spots from getting darker but also helps prevent new acne breakouts.\n3. You could try over-the-counter creams containing ingredients such as retinol, vitamin C, niacinamide, glycolic acid or azelaic acid that have been shown to lighten PIH. These work by encouraging cell turnover and reducing melanin production consequently fading the dark spots.\n4. If these interventions don't help, see a dermatologist who can suggest stronger prescription medications such as retinoids, hydroquinone, or professional treatments like chemical peels, microdermabrasion or laser therapy designed to remove the top layer of the skin, thus lightening the spots.\n\nRemember it takes time for pigmentation to fade, routine skincare, protection against UV rays, and patience is essential.

I experience this every year, as in yearly so I assumed it is normal. It is not hereditary, I assume, because none of my family members is experiencing it other than me.My mother told me that maybe it is because of cold weather which I agreed. It is there for the past 11 years. I have never consulted any professionals about it since it does not look severe. However, I am curious what is this condition called.", "output": "Based on the symptoms you described, it's possible that you might be suffering from a condition called Dyshidrotic eczema. This is a type of eczema that can cause small, itchy blisters on the hands and feet. Trigger factors include stress, seasonal allergies, and moist hands and feet; it may also have a link with cold weather. \n\nThe exact cause is unknown, and while not directly hereditary, people with a family history of atopic disorders such as eczema, hay fever, or asthma are more likely to develop it. While it typically doesn't pose a serious health threat, it can lead to discomfort, pain, and possibly skin infections if the blisters break open.\n\nI would recommend that you see a dermatologist for a definitive diagnosis and treatment plan. They may prescribe topical steroids to reduce inflammation and itching, and may advise on lifestyle changes to help manage symptoms (such as avoiding certain irritants or moisturizing frequently).

It can be combated with various non-invasive treatments.\n\nTopical Anti-Aging Serums: As you mentioned Retinol-A, this a good choice as they are known to promote skin renewal and enhance collagen production which helps in reducing the appearance of aging. However, remember that it takes time around, several months to see noticeable difference.\nVitamin C serums can provide protection against UV damage if they're formulated correctly. Look for ones that come in dark-colored containers (to protect against light oxidation) and store them away from heat. You want to look for formulations with L-ascorbic acid at a percentage of 10% -20%, and preferably formulated with Ferulic Acid/Vitamin E as those increase the efficiency of Vitamin C.

Blood work came back as total testosterone 381 and A1c 6.9. Started exercising and lost weight and inches, 198 lbs to 178, 38-inch waist to 32. Symptoms still persisted. The doctor started me on Clomid 50 mg three times per week.Testosterone shot up to 900\\s but symptoms persisted although Cialis helped with erection quality, still low libido. Will attach a note with test and A1c results during this time. So, I stopped taking the Clomid in March this year and had my physical last week.The doctor says my testosterone is 570, A1c is 6.0 and everything else looks good. He says since I still have symptoms, that I have testosterone resistance. His analogy was; like diabetics, their bodies produce insulin but just does not know what to do with it.So, his treatment recommendation is TRT testosterone replacement therapy along with Clomid. I am hesitant because I feel this therapy is overused nowadays, and I feel pretty good except my libido.Sought a second opinion today from my urologist, he seemed disinterested in me doing that but said if I try a few injections it would not hurt me, then advised me to run this by an endocrinologist.So I guess in summary:Do you believe that testosterone resistance is a valid diagnosis?If I do try the TRT, can I stop after a few weeks or a few injections and get back to the way I am right now with no permanent issues?Should I just start the Clomid again, or just keep using the Cialis and keep working out and trying to clean up my diet more?Any other thoughts and advise would be appreciated. Thanks.", "output": "This is a tough situation, and it's clear that you're feeling frustrated. To your questions:\n\n1) The concept of \"Testosterone Resistance\" exists but it isn't widely accepted or understood in the same way insulin resistance is, mostly due to lack of research on the topic. However, there are cases where normal testosterone levels still correspond with symptoms of Low T - which appears to be what is happening in your case.\n\n2) TRT doesn\u2019t have to be permanent and if you do decide to try it and find that it\u2019s not for you, then you can usually stop treatment without any longstanding issues. It may take some time (weeks to months) for your body to readjust and begin producing natural testosterone again. It might also impact fertility while you're on it which could extend after stopping. But this impact is generally reversible over time.\n\n3) As for resuming Clomid, taking Clomid had increased your testosterone levels but didn't relieve your symptoms. So, going back to it might not help your condition in terms of quality of life improvements.\n\n4) In addition to continuing exercise and maintaining a healthy diet, you might want to consider addressing other possible causes of low libido and erectile problems like sleep apnea, elevated prolactin levels, etc. You can discuss these possibilities with your endocrinologist as well.\n\nRemember that each individual response to medication varies greatly, so what works for one person might not work for another.

As my daughter is licking her fingers, my mom wants to keep castor oil or neem oil, is it safe to keep it on her finger?", "output": "Hello! Urai marundhu is a traditional Indian herbal medicine often given to babies, but it's very important to consult with your child's physician before starting any new medicinal treatment. While these medicines are natural, they could unintentionally cause harm if not used properly.\n\nAs for the use of castor oil or neem oil on your baby's fingers, it's generally not recommended. Your baby is at an age where putting their hands in their mouth is completely natural and helps them explore their world. However, both castor oil and neem oil can cause potential harm if ingested too much - symptoms might include diarrhea, nausea, abdominal cramps, vomiting. Moreover, neem oil may be toxic when consumed orally. \n\nHence, I would recommend sticking to regular hygiene practices like cleaning her hands regularly instead of using oils that could potentially be harmful if ingested. If you're concerned about excessive hand licking or other behaviors, please consider discussing this with a pediatrician."}

Previously, I failed to SSRI medications such as Zoloft, Prozac, Lexapro. I tried Lithium, Depakote, and Carbamazepine with no success.

And the second week on Lamictal. In a few days we will increase Lamictal to 100 mg and after two weeks to 200 mg. I also take Tranxene 10 mg if needed, as well as Olanzapine 10 mg. How come I responded to Venlafaxine XR so fast, when I did not respond to SSRI? I lack energy and motivation, should I increase Venlafaxine XR to 150? If so, will it have more effects on my anxiety and depressive episode?", "output": "Venlafaxine XR (Effexor) is a selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), which means it impacts two neurotransmitters in your brain: serotonin and norepinephrine. These two play a role in mood regulation, hence they are targeted in treating depression and anxiety disorders. The previously failed SSRI medications you tried only impact serotonin.\n\nResponding quickly to Venlafaxine may be due to the additional influence on norepinephrine, suggesting that in your case, the lack of energy and motivation might have been related to the noradrenergic system as well as the serotonergic system.\n\nAbout the dose increase, you're currently in early stages of treatment and both your Lamictal and Venlafaxine dosages are relatively low, so there's certainly room to adjust. Increasing Venlafaxine does have the potential to improve depressive symptoms and anxiety, but this should be discussed and monitored by your treating psychiatrist considering your overall symptom pattern, tolerability of current medication regime and other aspects of your mental health status.\n\nRemember that increasing a dosage could also potentially increase side effects, and changes should always be made gradually to assess tolerance and response. Always liaise with your healthcare provider about any changes or concerns regarding your medical treatment regimen."}

I was advised to take bed rest for three months and felt better after five months. Then I got some manipulation done with my lower back and my condition got worse. After that I had slight pain in my tail bone while walking and the pain got worse when I sit for five minutes. It got radiated to hips, thighs and it was worse when I stood up from a sitting position. Then I left with no option except bed rest for another four months that is a total nine months of bed rest. After that I suddenly started walking two to three hours a day in a stretch and started doing some exercises. After few days of getting my body too much into motion I felt my upper back getting stuck and again was unable to move and the pain radiated to my wrist and hand. Then had bed rest for another 10 days and felt a bit better. But, still in pain and resumed with two to three hours of brisk walking and exercises. I noticed that many joints in my body were making cracking sound while I walk or move my body and they were continuous. They are not going away no matter how much I move that joint, the cracking sound will repeat infinite times whenever I move my body. The cracking sound is mostly from lower and upper back, shoulder, ankle, foot fingers, knees also make that cracking sound and it is painful as well. Cracking sound in knees are felt more when I start walking after being in rest state and frequency of cracking sound reduces after walking for two to three minutes.I got my ESR and CRP checked.

Currently, I am on Esoz 40 and Telmekind H.", "output": "Your symptoms, which include a swollen gum around the treated tooth and associated bad smell, suggest an ongoing infection that may be due to the split tooth. This kind of dental abscess can sometimes lead to further complications such as spread of the infection.\n\nAs for the bumps and white coat on the back of your tongue, these could possibly be related to some type of yeast overgrowth (like candidiasis), oral thrush or it could also relate to other conditions like bacterial infections, irritation from prosthetics or certain types of oral cancer. However, there's no absolute direct correlation established between diseased teeth and these symptoms as they might even result from gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which is often treated with Esoz 40. \n\nEither way, these are both signs that you should return to see your dentist or an ENT specialist as soon as possible for diagnosis and treatment. They will do a complete evaluation of your oral health and recommend appropriate treatments based on their findings."}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hi doctor,I am a 30-year-old woman. I am having OCD since I was 12 years old. I have a strong fear of an event that happened a couple of years ago when a psychiatrist told me that I have a borderline disorder and have no fantasy. I was trying to ask her for years to say me the opposite as a compulsion. She refused to do that, I am not sure if it is because she did not want to change her opinion or it is because she did not want to satisfy my compulsion. My mother was encouraging me to do these kinds of compulsions as she thought it is going to get worse. It was a bad thing as she was validating my fears in this way. I just realized these things now so I started to confront my fears about what the psychiatrist said to me. But I ran into another one which is about what if my mother is right and if I am confronting my fears it is going to get worse. What do you think?", "output": "Based on your description, I can understand that the fear and doubt related to the diagnosis made by your previous psychiatrist is causing you distress. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) often involves grappling with persistent intrusive thoughts or fears.\n\nHowever, let's set some points straight: having OCD or borderline personality disorder does not mean that you aren't able to fantasize or imagine things. It could make it harder to separate reality from fearful thoughts at times, but it doesn't remove the ability altogether.\n\nConfronting fears is often a therapeutic approach in treating anxiety disorders including OCD. Exposure therapy is one such technique where an individual is gradually exposed to their feared object or obsessive thoughts without the presence of the dreaded outcome.\n\nRemember, though, it needs to be done under professional guidance because uncontrolled exposure might lead to more distress initially. It seems like you're experiencing the common worry many people with OCD have when they decide to face their fears - the \"what if\" scenarios start playing heavily.\n\nI strongly advise you seek help from a mental health professional who specializes in OCD. They can guide you through this process in a safe, controlled manner. The journey may be challenging, but with the right support and therapy, it can lead to much improvement. You should also consider involving your family in your therapy sessions so they can better understand your condition.\n  \nAs per Borderline Personality Disorder, it is an entirely different condition that would need confirmation from a psychiatrist with careful evaluation.

I also feel like I literally cannot breathe. I have to take deep breaths constantly. I went to an urgent care and they tested for a blood clot in the lungs, but I was cleared. My doctor put me on Lexapro two months ago and I stopped taking it. But then the anxiety got so bad that I started again on it two weeks ago. My fear is that there is something wrong with my heart. I have had this before and chest pain. So, I have been to two different cardiologists. We did stress tests and echoes. I am afraid these doctors are blowing me off because I am active. Please advise.", "output": "I understand your worries, anxiety can indeed feel physically overwhelming at times. Symptoms you described sound like they might be related to anxiety attacks, which are often associated with symptoms such as heart palpitations, shortness of breath and feelings of unease.\n\nFrom what you mentioned, extensive cardiac tests - including stress test and echos - were done. These types tests are very sensitive in picking up potential heart diseases. If the results were normal, then it\u2019s highly unlikely that there's a problem with your heart health, even if you continue having chest pain or discomfort. \n\nGoing back on Lexapro could help manage your anxiety symptoms but please ensure that you follow your doctor's advice when it comes to starting or stopping medication -- stopping abruptly can potentially worsen anxiety.\n\nIf you don't see any improvement from taking Lexapro or other anti-anxiety medications, consider seeking help from a therapist or psychiatrist for cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Therapists who specialize in CBT can offer strategies to manage panic attacks and reduce generalized anxiety. You could also benefit from regular exercise and good sleep habits.\n\nOverall, it would be best to stay in close communication with your healthcare provider to guide you through this process you're going through. It can take some weeks before antidepressants like Lexapro begin to have noticeable effects, so patience is key. But keep in mind that everyone responds differently to medication, reach out to your healthcare provider if Lexapro isn\u2019t helping or if you\u2019re experiencing side effects.\n"}

I just had to switch the other doctor because of insurance and my new doctor says old stress echos are irrelevant, that only chemical or nuclear echos work in patients with lbbb. Is this true? I have a strong family history of heart disease, my father survived two heart attacks, mother survived double bypass and my maternal uncle died from a heart attack, all were smokers with high cholesterol and high blood pressure. I am a former smoker. I am a 43-year-old female. I have been exercising six days per week for over 20 years. My cholesterol is high 213 but HDL is 140 and triglycerides are low.

I am currently taking Spironolactone 100 mg for acne, Omeprazole, and multivitamins. I just had an ultrasound of heart and EKG past monday. Doctor did not mention anything other than lbbb that was previously diagnosed.", "output": "The decision between an exercise echocardiography and a nuclear stress test ultimately depends on the specific concerns your doctor has in mind, but also on individual patient factors. It is not necessarily true that only chemical or nuclear echo stress tests can be used in patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB). Exercise or dobutamine stress echocardiography can be useful for detecting significant coronary artery disease in individuals with LBBB. However within the medical community there\u2019s a debate over their respective effectiveness in these cases.\n\nNuclear stress testing might potentially offer more reliable results as they're less dependent on image quality and interpretability than the standard stress echos. They can provide a more detailed understanding of the presence and severity of coronary artery disease, especially so for patients with pre-existing abnormalities like LBBB. \n\nGiven that you have a strong family history of heart disease and high cholesterol, it's essential to get regular check-ups and to monitor your condition closely. Always consult your doctor about any concerns that you may have, and consider seeking a second opinion if you're uncertain about your care plan.\n\nLastly, I encourage maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Regular physical activity, eating a balanced diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, avoiding smoking, and ensuring appropriate stress management, are all critical factors for cardiac health. You might want to consider discussing with your physician about the use of statins given your high cholesterol levels.\n\nHowever, this advice does not overwrite the assessment given by your treating doctor, who is familiar"}

I am concerned if I am able to have a VBAC delivery with my second pregnancy since my first pregnancy resulted in an emergency C-section. Also, I am 48. What are the risks of pregnancy in women over 40?", "output": "Hello,\nHaving a baby later in life can carry unique health considerations, but that doesn't mean you cannot have a healthy pregnancy. The decision to try for a vaginal delivery after a C-section (VBAC) involves many factors. While it is possible for many women who've had a C-section to attempt a VBAC, repeated C-sections could be recommended upon your medical history and circumstances.\n\nMain risk during a VBAC is uterine rupture which might require an emergency c-section or even complete hysterectomy. As for being aged 48, there are indeed higher risks involved with pregnancy. \n\nRisks of getting pregnant over the age of 40 include:\n\n1. Pre-existing chronic conditions like diabetes or high blood pressure.\n2. Increased chance of preeclampsia or gestational diabetes. \n3. Higher risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, or chromosomal abnormalities such as Down syndrome.\n4. More likely to have complications during labor leading to a c-section.\n5. Chances of multiple pregnancy (such as twins or triplets) which have their own set of complications.\n\nThe chances of having a healthy pregnancy, while lower compared to younger women, can still be higher if you take care of your health. Regular antenatal checkups, good diet nutrition, regular moderate exercises and avoiding smoking, alcohol etc can contribute towards having a safe and healthy pregnancy at this age. It's also suggested to consult a genetic counselor for advanced maternal age pregnancies to help assess potential risks and"}

The recurrent nature, accompanying fever and swelling of lymph nodes suggest an ongoing and significant immune response.\n\nYour current medications are broad-spectrum antibiotics which should cover a wide range of bacterial infections. However, they will not be effective against fungal infections or viral ones. Additionally, prolonged use of antibiotics can disturb your normal oral and gut microbiota leading to secondary infections like oral thrush (fungal), which might explain the white layer on your tongue.\n\nIt's important to further investigate. You may need blood work, throat swabs/cultures for bacteria, viruses, and fungi and possibly an endoscopy (camera examination of the oesophagus) considering the difficultly swallowing and vomiting after eating.\n\nPlease also ensure proper hydration and nutrition as ongoing illness and difficulty swallowing can lead to undernourishment.\n\nYou should discuss these symptoms with your doctor urgently and ask about further diagnostic testing including labs and potentially, referral to an ENT(clinical focus on diseases of ear, nose, and throat) specialist or infectious disease specialist."}

What is the treatment?Is there any chance of getting other eye affected?", "output": "Hello,\n\nTo address your concerns:\n\n1. What should you do: It may be advised to periodically take short breaks from staring at the screen to allow your eyes to rest. Use this time to blink and adjust your focus. Also, ensure that there is appropriate lighting in your workspace. Special glasses specifically designed for computer work might also help. \n\n2. Professional changes: If you're passionate about web development and you enjoy your profession, it's not necessary to consider switching jobs. There are certainly ways of managing eye strain and promoting good ocular health even within a field like web development which requires long hours of screen exposure.\n\n3. Cure and treatment: Amblyopia (lazy eye) can usually be treated early in life by patching the stronger eye or using eyeglasses. In some cases, surgery may be needed. As an adult, complete correction may not be possible but some improvement can still be expected. You should get your eyes tested by a specialist right away for detailed treatment advice.\n\n4. Chances of other eye getting affected: The lazy eye condition typically affects only one eye.

However, I would like to know if the use of stem cell creams can worsen the melasma by encouraging the growth of melanin? Currently, I am taking Tranexamic acid, Cipramil, Valdoxan.", "output": "Firstly, it is good that you are getting Q-switched laser treatment for melasma, as this can be an effective option in cases where topical treatments haven't provided sufficient results. Hydroquinone is also standardly used to treat hyperpigmentation like melasma.\n\nRegarding the use of stem cell creams: It's important to note that there isn't extensive research on their effect on melasma. Most stem cell creams claim to encourage cellular regeneration, reduce signs of aging and improve overall skin health, but they aren't specific to encouraging the growth of melanin. \n\nHowever, because the science behind these products is still growing, they might work differently from person to person. If you have been noticing a worsening in your melasma after using a certain product, it would be best to discontinue it and consult with your dermatologist.\n\nFor Tranexamic acid, Cipramil (Citalopram), and Valdoxan (agomelatine): Although none of them should worsen melasma directly, individual reactions to medication can vary. The medications you mentioned primarily deal with mood disorders (Cipramil and Valdoxan) and preventing blood clots (Tranexamic Acid). However, stress and hormonal imbalances have been linked to increase risk of developing or worsening pigmentation issues like melasma, so stabilizing mood could potentially help control such conditions indirectly.

What are the home remedies used to get rid of it?", "output": "Constipation can often be managed with lifestyle changes. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. Increase fiber intake: Make sure your son includes plenty of high-fiber foods in his diet, such as fruits (like pears and prunes), vegetables, and whole grains. Fiber works by increasing the water content and bulkiness of the stool, which helps it move through the intestines easier.\n\n2. Hydrate: Ensuring he drinks enough fluids each day is important. Water is a great choice.\n\n3. Regular exercise: Exercise helps stimulate the flow of waste through the digestive tract.\n\n4. Create a routine: Encourage your son to establish consistent bathroom habits. Trying to have a bowel movement at the same time each day can train body to follow a regular schedule.\n\n5. Avoid holding in stools: If your son feels an urge to go, encourage him not to delay - this can lead to drier, harder stools that are more difficult to pass. \n\nWhile these remedies can help, if constipation continues for a prolonged duration despite making lifestyle modifications or comes along with other symptoms like abdominal pain, blood in stool, weakness, unexpected weight loss or changes in sleep/appetite, make sure you seek immediate medical attention as it may indicate something more serious.

It's common to experience pain or sensitivity after a tooth filling, usually due to inflammation of the area around the filled tooth; this typically subsides within a few days.\n\nHere are some steps you can take at home:\n1. Over-the-counter analgesics: Non-prescription pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen may help.\n2. Cold compress: Applying a cold pack to the affected side of your face for 15 minutes every hour could also reduce pain and swelling.\n3. Rinse with salt water: Dissolve half a teaspoon of salt in 8 ounces of warm water, then swish it around your mouth before spitting it out. Do this several times a day as it can soothe the sore area.\n\nAvoid consuming hot, cold, or sweet foods and drinks which might provoke sensitivity. Also, try not to chew on the side where your filling is, as this could make the inflammation worse. \n\nHowever, if the pain persists, intensifies over time or is accompanied by other symptoms such as fever, swollen glands, etc., seek emergency dental care immediately.

{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor, For ten years, my husband has been successfully using an extended wear bandage contact lens (monthly wear) to control the pain of aphakic bullous keratopathy in one eye. About seven months ago, he had an episode of foreign body pain in the eye which the contact lens could not control. His optometrist changed the type of lens after remarking that the lens appeared tight. Although the painful sensations have decreased, they are still present with more of a sore feeling now. His ophthalmologist suggested that he discontinue the Azopt drops he had been using in case the preservative was causing some corneal toxicity. His eye pressure without the drops has read at 18 and 20 on separate occasions, but he does have corneal edema which may affect the measurement. He has had high pressure in that eye previously, but it was mostly lowered by Cyclodiode treatment some eight years ago. The consultant said he had left him on the Azopt drops just as a precaution. My query is that if the bandage lens has worked so well for pain management for 10 years is it possible that it can continue to work? And if the Azopt drops and their preservative had caused some toxic reaction seven months ago, could that still be causing him to feel the discomfort? His consultant suggested out that he could have the eye removed to control the pain, but as he has what he feels is some slight, useful vision in that eye, he does not want to take such a drastic and life-changing step. In fact, he wants to pursue the least invasive course of action to relieve the pain he is getting. I would appreciate any advice you could give as he is in quite a bit of pain.", "output": "It's quite possible that the bandage lens can still be used to manage your husband's eye pain. Over time, due to changes in the shape of the eye or other alterations, it may become necessary to switch types or fit of contact lenses, exactly as his optometrist did. Hence if the newly fitted lens seems not to be controlling the pain as effectively as before, perhaps another revisit to the optometrist would help reassess the fitting/comfort of that lens.\n\nIn regards to the Azopt drops, it can theoretically cause a toxic reaction or allergic conjunctivitis but such instances are rare. However, if it is indeed the preservative causing discomfort, discontinuing the medication should eliminate the pain once everything has cleared from the eye, which typically takes a few weeks. It is unlikely that the toxicity would linger for seven months, unless he continued using the drops during this period. \n\nWhile enucleation (removing the eye) is one way to permanently alleviate the pain, it does seem quite drastic especially considering your husband still retains some vision in that eye. The presence of corneal edema suggests there is still inflammation, and dealing with this might actually resolve some of the pain issues. Topical anti-inflammatory treatments, hypertonic saline drops, or ointment to decrease corneal edema could all potentially be helpful depending on the specifics of your husband's case.\n\nHowever, these responses are based purely on the information you've given and should not replace a thorough"}

It worked for the first 20 days, but for the past five days, my pain has increased significantly. Is it homeopathy aggravation or something else?", "output": "It's difficult to determine without an examination, but it could be either. Homeopathy aggravation is a transient worsening of symptoms after starting homeopathy treatment, which might explain why your pain has increased in the last 5 days. On the other hand, your fissure may not have completely healed or there may be another underlying issue contributing to your increased pain.\n\nAs a next step, you should consider making an appointment with your health-care provider to discuss these recent changes in your condition.

For some days I have noticed froth in urine and facial puffiness. I want your suggestion. My RFT was normal but I have not checked my urine for protein or USG abdomen. Can you please guide me regarding further management?", "output": "Hello, based on your symptoms which include froth in urine and facial puffiness, you might be having some kidney issues. These could indicate that your kidneys are not filtering your blood as well as they should be, which may cause protein (specifically albumin) to leak into your urine, causing it to froth.\n\nConsidering your hypertension, presence of these symptoms may suggest a condition called nephrotic syndrome. It is crucial that you get your health evaluated as soon as possible. Here are a few examinations I recommend:\n\n1. Urine Tests: An analysis for proteinuria (excess protein in urine) and microscopic examination will be useful to evaluate your case.\n\n2. Kidney Function Test: Although you mentioned your recent renal function tests were normal, repeating them can provide updated information about your kidney's health status.\n\n3. Ultrasonography KUB (Kidney-Ureter-Bladder): This can reveal the physical state of your kidneys and can detect abnormalities such as changes in kidney size or structure.\n\n4. Consult with a Nephrologist: Depending on the results of above tests, consider consulting with a specialist in kidney disorders for further management.\n\nIt is also important for you to continue monitoring and managing your blood pressure, as uncontrolled hypertension can lead to kidney damage over time.\n \nHowever, before proceeding with any of the advice, consult with your healthcare provider because your current physical situation/medical history must be considered."}

Seasonal allergens like dust mites, mold and pollen flowers are more prevalent at certain times of the year (like the end) which could be triggering your coughing episodes. External factors in winter like indoor heating systems, smoke, dry air, etc, can also worsen respiratory symptoms.\n\nAsthma is another possibility as it typically worsens during cold months due to increased sensitivity to cold air. To get a correct diagnosis, I would recommend that you take an allergy test and spirometry (a simple test used to help diagnose and monitor asthma). Please discuss these possibilities with your doctor so they can better guide treatment options.\n\nMaintaining hydration, using humidifiers, wearing masks, avoiding allergens and triggers and taking over-the-counter allergy medicines will possibly help decrease your symptoms.

I am puzzled as to where an infection could come from. My doctor thinks it is a bacterial infection and has put me on antibiotics. I am very worried about cancer. Should I be?", "output": "Your stress and worry are understandable, especially during these challenging times. Looking into the facts you provided, elevated neutrophils and White Blood Cell (WBC) count often indicate an infection or inflammation, which correlates with your recent severe eye infection. The eye infection could have triggered this elevated WBC response, as your body fights to overcome it. \n\nA high ESR rate also indicates inflammation in the body; again, this could be due to your eye infection.\n\nHowever, remember that blood tests only offer a snapshot of what's going on at one particular moment in time - they do not define your overall health.\n\nCancer typically presents with other symptoms like significant weight loss, exhaustion, night sweats, unexplained pain etc. If you don't have any such problems, cancer is less likely. Also, regarding bacterial infections - they can occur even with the utmost precaution. For example, bacteria live on our skin and inside our bodies all the time. They usually don't cause trouble unless our immune system is weakened or if they enter a part of the body where they're not usually found, such as the eye.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the information provided, there's no need to jump to the assumption that you may have something as serious as cancer. Instead, clear communication with your healthcare provider is key here. Discuss your concerns and worries with them. If needed, conducting further tests can provide more clarity on the situation.

She is a very adamant kid and still screams if things do not go her way. Suggest remedies to get rid of hoarseness. Please remove my anxiety towards cancer.", "output": "I understand your worries as a parent, but I can reassure you that in children of this age, hoarseness after crying out loud or having tantrums is really common. \n\nThis happens because the vocal cords become irritated due to the strain placed upon them during intense bouts of crying or screaming. Drinking warm water with honey was a good move - it's often recommended as a way to soothe the throat. Also, allowing her voice to rest (to the extent a 2-year-old can) could help her recover more quickly.\n\nChildren exhibiting signs of laryngeal cancer are extremely rare. The symptoms are persistent hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, noticeable lump in the neck, unexplained weight loss, bad breath, and sometimes ear pain. If none of these other symptoms are presenting along with the hoarseness, then I believe it is very unlikely that she has any form of cancer.\n\nFor now, try encouraging her to use her \"inside voice,\" meaning not to scream or cry at such high volumes, if possible. This will be the best preventative measure against future episodes of hoarseness. I would also encourage continued hydration; perhaps try avoiding cold treats like ice cream if her throat seems particularly sensitive at times. \n\nIf the hoarseness persists for several weeks without improvement, or if additional symptoms arise, please consult with a pediatrician just to rule out any infections or non-cancerous growths on her vocal cords.

When I try to stand him up, he is reluctant and seems to be scared and cries when standing. I am worried. Should I be concerned? Do I need to check his hips? Had appointments with a doctor and he never identified any physiological problems.", "output": "It's common for parents to have concerns about their child's developmental milestones. By 15 months, most children are able to stand and possibly walk on their own, but there is a wide range of normal development. Some children may take a little longer.\n\nYour son already shows signs that he is getting ready to stand up as he crawls and pulls his knees. His reluctance towards standing could indicate a lack of confidence or simply personal preference instead of physical issues. It has also been noticed that some kids who are good at crawling do not show an inclination towards walking early as they might be finding it more efficient to move around by crawling.\n\nYour paediatrician should perform a hip exam as part of the routine well-child checkups. If your doctor has done this and found no physiological problems, then physical abnormalities with the hips are likely not the cause of delayed standing/walking unless new symptoms arise or the condition worsens.\n\nThat said, you could consider consulting a pediatric physiotherapist if such services are available in your region. They can provide exercises to help with strength and balance which could help in improving his confidence to stand and walk.\n\nAlways continue monitoring his progress and consult your doctor regularly. If he isn't making any attempts to weight bear or hasn't started to walk by eighteen months, it would be worth revisiting the conversation with your doctor."}

Can I go to the gym?", "output": "Hello there. Don't worry, a varicocele is a somewhat common condition and I am here to help you understand it.\n\nFirstly, yes, varicoceles can be treated with both surgical and non-surgical procedures, including embolization or open surgery, depending on the severity and associated symptoms. The primary goal of treatment is relieving any pain or discomfort you might have and treating infertility, if that's an issue for you.\n\nAs for its impact on your sexual life, it varies from person to person. Some men may experience pain during intercourse due to the varicocele, while others don't notice any significant difference in their sexual lives. It should not directly affect your libido or ability to maintain an erection.\n\nRegarding fertility, studies show that about 40% of men with known infertility have a varicocele. However, many men with a varicocele are able to father children without any problems. If you're concerned about your fertility, a variety of tests are available to assess your sperm count, motility, and morphology.\n\nSexual activity does not complicate varicoceles nor makes them worse. You do not necessarily need to avoid sexual intercourse unless it\u2019s causing you significant pain.

Low normal systolic function with an ejection fraction of 54.A normal right ventricle size and function.Mildly dilated left atrium.Mildly dilated aortic root (41 mm) and ascending aorta (41 mm).In addition, it is noted that my resting ejection fraction last year was 64 and my stress echo taken this year (for atypical chest pain) was 62. My cardiologist says all my echo parameters are stable and he does not want to see me for another year. Despite my cardiologist reassuring me and I having nothing to worry about, I remain a little concerned about the drop in my ejection fraction from last year to this year. Should I be worried about this or is it still in the normal range?", "output": "The normal range for ejection fraction, which is a measure of how well your heart is pumping blood, is generally between 50% and 70%. Your current ejection fraction of 54% is within the normal limits albeit towards the lower end. However, it's important to understand that ejection fraction can vary in different scenarios or tests. \n\nA small fluctuation in ejection fraction, like you have experienced, does not necessarily indicate a problem especially when other parameters remain stable as reported by your cardiologist. Your doctor also takes into consideration all aspects of your health including other results from your echo that appear to be either normal or compensated.\n\nThe consistency in your other results indicates no immediate threat. For instance, the moderate regurgitation of your aortic valve seems well-compensated, meaning that your heart is managing this without detriment to its function. Aorta and left atrium are mildly dilated but considering your age, these may just represent changes seen with aging.\n\nHowever, since you continue to have concerns, I would advise you to keep any follow-up appointments and reach out to your doctor if there are new symptoms, or worsening of existing symptoms, such as shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling in the legs, etc. Lifestyle modifications like regular exercise (if allowed by your doctor), maintaining a healthy weight and diet, controlling blood pressure and cholesterol levels may also help maintain good cardiovascular health. \n\nRemember, online advice should never replace a face-to-face consultation with your healthcare provider"}

Each of these conditions can impact lung function and cause dyspnea (breathlessness). \n\nIn terms of management, continuation of Methylprednisolone for the inflammatory process is recommended, as it could reduce inflammation in the lungs. Diuretics might also be beneficial if there is significant residual pleural fluid that is contributing to the breathlessness.\n\nManagement from a palliative perspective must also be considered given her metastatic breast cancer. This could include nebulized medications to help alleviate the feeling of breathlessness, opioids such as morphine which could help with breathless sensation by working centrally on receptors and offering some relief.\n\nThe talc related leg injury may not directly contribute to the breathlessness but managing pain and promoting mobility could indirectly improve her condition.\n\nPulmonary rehabilitation therapy could potentially be beneficial, focusing on strengthening her respiratory muscles and improving her conditioning overall. However, the feasibility and usefulness of this intervention would depend on the extent of her disease and general strength level.\n\nLastly, because she has multiple co-morbidities, I recommend regular follow-up with her primary care team including oncologist, pulmonologist and palliative care specialist for comprehensive management of her complex case.

It's important to avoid sharing items such as toothbrushes or razors that could have traces of infected blood on them.\n\nIn terms of treatment options, there's currently no complete cure for Hepatitis B virus (HBV). However, the disease can often be managed effectively with medication and lifestyle changes to minimize symptoms and prevent further liver damage. Routine check-ups are necessary in order to monitor the condition.\n\nThe time it takes for an individual\u2019s body to clear the virus depends on the individual\u2019s immune system. While some people can eliminate the virus from their bodies quickly within weeks, others may become long-term \"chronic\" carriers of the virus.\n\nOnce diagnosed though, a healthcare provider will be able to provide accurate advice tailored to your specific situation and health conditions based on ongoing regular tests and monitoring.

This condition is known as polycythemia, which means that your body is making too many red cells.\n\nPolycythemia could be primary (due to problems with the bone marrow) or secondary (a response to low oxygen levels in the body). It can increase the chances of developing serious health issues like clots, heart attacks, or strokes. Smoking can contribute to this condition by decreasing the amount of oxygen in your blood.\n\nIn addition, those symptoms can indicate other medical conditions including hormonal imbalances, infection, anemia, or neurological conditions, just to name a few. A miscarriage may also affect hormone levels temporarily and thus might be contributing to these symptoms. \n\nTherefore, due to the severity of potential underlying causes, I would recommend you seek healthcare attention promptly.

Genetic testing may provide some insight if chromosomal abnormalities are causing the recurrent miscarriages. Both partners could undergo karyotype analysis, which can help identify any genetic issues.\n\nAlso, few tests like Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS), or Lupus Anticoagulant (LA) test can also be considered for autoimmune causes of recurrent miscarriage.\n\nI would also recommend checking for Vitamin D insufficiency, since this deficiency has often been associated with infertility/miscarriages.\n\nRegarding medications, continuing Aspirin, folic acid, and B12 supplementation sound appropriate, but please ensure she is doing so under her doctor's guidance.\n\nMaintaining a balanced diet and healthy lifestyle are of utmost importance too. Encourage her to exercise regularly and manage stress levels as these factors can significantly influence conception outcomes.\n\nAlways remember to consult the treating doctor before making any medical decisions based on these recommendations.

Coughing up blood can certainly be concerning, but it doesn't necessarily mean you have lung cancer. Smoking and being in a heavily polluted area could have irritated your respiratory tract and cause small amounts of bleeding. However, persistent blood in your sputum warrants a medical evaluation to rule out other conditions like bronchitis, pneumonia or tuberculosis that are also common in smokers. \n\nMoreover, the fact that you were unable to breathe in a heavily polluted area may indicate that your lungs are already damaged from smoking and cannot handle additional irritants.\n\nPlease get checked by a healthcare provider as soon as possible. Physicians can perform a physical examination and order necessary tests such as a chest X-ray or CT scan to determine if there is an underlying condition causing these symptoms.

Cognitive and neurological examination: This may include tests of memory, problem-solving, attention, counting, language, mood, personality, type and level of consciousness, coordination, balance and other mental functions.\n\n2. Lab tests: Blood tests may help rule out physical problems that can affect brain function, such as a deficiency in Vitamin B12 or an underactive thyroid gland.\n\n3.

However, on the basis of what you've described, it is not unusual to have broken bones without experiencing severe pain, especially if fractures are non-displaced (bones haven't moved out of their regular alignment). \n\nIf your physician reviewed the radiographic images and confirmed that both elbows are broken, then most likely they are correct. Keep in mind that doctors receive extensive training in interpreting these types of images.\n\nRegarding the treatment aspect, it largely depends on the type, location, and severity of the fracture. Casts immobilize the joint to promote healing, prevent movement that might interfere with bone repair, and help manage pain \u2013 especially when stretching or moving. The timeframe of 2-3 weeks for a cast seems rather short; typically, it may take around 6 weeks or more for an adult's bone to heal, but again, this varies depending on the specific case. Of course, you would also need to consider physical therapy for restoration of function after any casting period. \n\nAgain, this is general advice and your own treating doctor, who has all the information about your particular situation, will be able to give you the best recommendations."}

Is a ketone diet good for those who are diabetic?", "output": "Ketogenic or \"keto\" diet is a low carbohydrate, high fat diet. The idea behind this diet is to make your body use fat as a form of energy instead of using carbohydrates that it usually uses. \n\nThere are several potential benefits for the ketogenic diet:\n\n1. Weight Loss: As the body starts burning fats instead of carbs for primary energy, weight loss can be faster compared to normal diets.\n\n2. Controlling Blood Sugar: Since the amount of carbohydrates intake is drastically reduced, blood sugar level often drops which makes it beneficial for people with diabetes.\n\n3. Epilepsy: The ketogenic diet was initially developed in the 1920s for patients suffering from epilepsy; very often professionals see significant reduction in seizures in patients following a ketogenic diet.\n\n4. Cognitive Health: Some studies suggest improvement in cognitive functions and memory of those who follow a ketogenic diet. However, more research is needed in this area.\n\n5. Other possible benefits: Reduction in cholesterol levels, blood pressure, insulin resistance, acne, etc.\n\nHowever, every individual is different and what works well for one person may not work for another. For Diabetics, while the keto diet can help by reducing glucose levels (as low-carb diets can reduce insulin production), on the flip side, a poorly managed keto diet can also lead to dangerously low blood sugar levels.\n\nAlso, the transition from a regular diet to the Ketogenic diet can cause some temporary health conditions like keto flu, constipation, nutrient deficiencies,"}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,I flossed by a tooth where a filling almost came out and my tooth and gum have been hurting all night. Also have a tooth that is by this molar that fell or chipped out. I do not know if it is an abscess or an exposed nerve in my molar that is right behind it. Took Tylenol 2 every 6 hours twice. It did not help. Used Benzocaine on the area. Helped 20 %. Do not feel comfortable using it at home.", "output": "Based on the symptoms you've described, it sounds like you may have an infection or a cavity in your tooth where the filling almost came out, and possible damage to another tooth where you say it's chipped or fallen out. This could be causing significant pain due to exposed nerve or abscess formation.\n\nYou did the right thing by taking Tylenol to manage the pain, albeit without much success, and Benzocaine for temporary relief. Importantly, using these measures at home are only a temporary solution and a means of managing the discomfort.\n\nA visit to the dentist is essential as soon as possible. They will be able to properly examine the affected area, may take x-rays to accurately diagnose the issue, and propose appropriate treatment - whether that's a root canal, new filling, extraction, or something else.\n\nIn the meantime, continue with the over-the-counter analgesics (like the Tylenol) as long its use is not contraindicated for you. Make sure to keep up a good oral hygiene regimen to prevent any potential worsening of the situation. \n\nHowever, if you experience severe swelling, trouble breathing or swallowing, you should seek emergency medical attention immediately as these can be signs of a more serious infection.\n"}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hi doctor,I have polycystic ovary syndrome and my periods get delayed sometimes. From the past four days, I am having pain in my left pelvic area. I got an ultrasound done, and it shows 4.5 cm cyst in my right ovary. Why am I having pain on my left side when the cyst is on the right? Could this pain be due to the cyst?", "output": "The pain could be due to a number of possible reasons. Firstly, in polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), multiple small cysts develop in both ovaries (not just one), which can cause lower abdominal or pelvic discomfort on either side.\n\nSecondly, 'referred pain' is quite common with ovarian cysts. This means that although the cyst is present in your right ovary, you might feel the pain on your left side. The reason for this is that the nerves in your abdomen don't have a specific line, so the brain sometimes has difficulty interpreting where exactly the pain is coming from.\n\nThirdly, other conditions unrelated to ovaries can also cause pelvic pain, like kidney stones, gastrointestinal disorders, urinary tract infections, etc. \n\nWhile it's possible that this pain may not be directly due to the cyst, it's essential that you get evaluated by your doctor who will take into account your symptoms and rule out other causes. Persistent or worsening pain should always be evaluated further. Be sure to monitor your symptoms and report them accurately to your healthcare provider."}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hi doctor,My 4 years son had a cough for two days. Now his cough is fine but now he has a high fever on the head side but his hands are ice cold. He is telling pain sometimes in hands and some times in feet. What is the cause? Please explain.", "output": "Based on your son's symptoms, it seems like he might have a viral or bacterial infection. Symptoms can vary significantly and exact cause may be unknown without proper examination. High temperature is body's response in fighting infections. The difference in the temperature between his head and hands could also be due to fever, when blood vessels in the periphery (like hands and legs) constrict to maintain core body temperature resulting in cold hands and feet.\n\nPain in hands and feet can sometimes happen in children due to growth spurts but can also be symptom of illness. Other possible causes could include dehydration or less commonly some rheumatologic conditions. \n\nHowever, these are just possibilities. It's important that you seek immediate medical care for your child considering his high fever and complaints about pain. A healthcare professional can perform a physical examination and possibly other diagnostic tests to determine the actual cause.\n"}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hi doctor,My wife is indifferent to child health issues. She controls the child with threatening words. The child cannot cry or weep even with an extreme reprimand by her. She makes the child sleep under extreme pressure. Sometimes, the child wets the bed. She then becomes furious with him. All this has led him to be a withdrawn child and always compromising. Please suggest me.", "output": "It sounds like you're describing a difficult home situation that is impacting the mental and emotional health of your child. It's critical to understand that children thrive in supportive, caring environments. It's important to have open communication about proper parenting techniques with your wife which should be based on understanding, mutual respect, patience, and love.\n\nAs a doctor, I highly recommend seeking professional help in this case. Consider family counseling or individual therapy for all involved. A licensed counselor or psychologist can provide strategies and techniques to improve the household environment, the mother-child relationship, and can also provide support to your child during this stressful time.\n\nIn extreme cases where there are concerns about your child's safety, it may be necessary to involve child protective services.\n\nLastly, focus on providing reassurance to your child. Let him know that he's heard, loved, and understood, which will be integral in his progress dealing with this situation. Encourage your child to express his feelings through creative means such as drawing, writing, painting, or storytelling; these can be helpful tools to allow him to vent out his feelings in a positive way.\n\nRemember, continuous bed wetting could be a sign of high-stress levels in your child due to the traumatic experiences at home. Consultation with a pediatrician can also be valuable in managing this symptom and assessing whether there may be any other physical impacts from the stress your child is under."}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hi doctor, I have been taking Effexor XR 300 mg for depression. It has been working really well. My psychiatrist has now prescribed me Strattera for ADHD. I am about to start 25 mg and work my way upto 80 mg over a few weeks. Strattera and Effexor both seem to inhibit Norepinephrine reuptake. Is it safe to take this combination? I know my psychiatrist knows what he is doing, but I wanted to get a second opinion from others.", "output": "Effexor (venlafaxine) and Strattera (atomoxetine) are both known to affect the uptake of norepinephrine, as you mentioned. While it is generally safe to take these two drugs together under careful medical supervision, there can be potential risks.\n\nA key risk is a condition referred to as Serotonin Syndrome, which can occur when medications that impact serotonin levels in the brain are combined. Symptoms of this syndrome usually involve changes in mental status, autonomic nervous system instability, neuromuscular difficulty, and gastrointestinal issues.\n\nAnother potential issue is an increase in blood pressure or heart rate, because both medicines can potentially have these side effects individually.\n\nHowever, please remember that your psychiatrist has examined you and knows your medical history better. He or she would only make this decision if they believe the benefits outweigh the possible risks. It's always important to share any concerns with them so they can monitor you for potential side effects more closely.\n\nBut having said all that, if you're still feeling unsure about combining these medications, you could also consider reaching out to a pharmacist or another psychiatrist for a second opinion. It's important that you feel confident and comfortable with your treatment plan. Make sure to never alter or stop taking prescribed medication without consulting with your healthcare provider first."}
