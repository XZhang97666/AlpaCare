I have no idea what has brought this on or whether it can be reversed. I am so stressed out. I have to be on my feet for my job for about four and a half hours every morning. Can this be tested to see if the nerve cells are either dead or just damaged and can it be reversed? This feels like it is going to ruin my life. Please help.", "output": "\nIt is difficult to diagnose your condition without a physical examination and further testing.

It lasts a second or two but may repeat several times before stopping in five minutes or so. I went out in the garden today to dig a bit and wearing my HR monitor (I have got health anxiety, anxiety disorder as well as depression). As I was digging, the pain started hurting with each heartbeat. I looked at my monitor and it read 138 bpm. I am 70 years old and have been on medication (Benzodiazepines) for over 50 years for panic attacks and general anxiety. Two years ago I felt similar pain but not to this extent. I went to ER but nothing was found (the doctor said it could be costochondritis but definitely not my heart). I get bloodwork quarterly and everything was fine except cholesterol which was 235. I tried a statin but the muscle pain was too great. In my EKG I have RBBB or LAFB which 14 years back after a stress test I was told that I was probably born with it. I had gone to see the cardiologist then because of getting skipped beats and GERD he told me to ignore them. Last time I had an EKG was in the ER for six months when I had a weird pain in back and side. They checked out heart anyway and said it was fine. Probably just a colicky gallbladder. I have had stones for more than 20 years and had no surgery. So I hesitate to go to the ER again. My local doctor just closed. HR is still 88 while lying down right now.

Now after 10 months has passed I found out that I have two warts inside my vagina. It is white color although, the one on the top started to have a slight pink color. But the second one on the bottom which is much smaller still has completely white color and around the vagina blades, I have a little while dots. Also, there are very tiny warts line along the blades. So, when I went to see the GP near my house he had a look and said that there is nothing to worry it is still small. But in my opinion, I think it is quite big. So the doctor gave me a prescription for Condyline paint which he told me to use for three days only per week and I have to keep using it for three weeks and if it does not get better he told me to see him again. Now I have a few questions. Is this mean I have an HPV virus inside my body? How can I make the virus go away permanently? Will Gardasil injection make it go away? If it does not go away permanently, how can I make sure that I have no HPV viruses and so these warts will not come back again? Is this mean that I have this HPV from my boyfriend?

{"instruction": "", "input": "Hi doctor,I am a 49-year-old woman and last month I was hospitalized with a necrotizing soft tissue infection on my thigh. I had two debridement surgeries and was discharged after 5 days. I was treated with about 4 IV antibiotics. I do not remember them all, I recall seeing Vancomycin and Penicillin. I was told that the infection was not MRSA, but a \"slower moving bacteria\" they did not tell me what it was. I was swabbed for MRSA in my nose and butt before both surgeries and was told I did not have it. For the last day of my stay, I had a roommate who had a bad MRSA infection on her butt and sometimes had diarrhea incontinence during dressing changes. I had no physical contact with her, but we had the same nurse. I was discharged with a five day course of Augmentin.The wound has been healing very well and has not gotten infected, but three weeks after discharge I got an abscess under my arm. I went to an urgent care and was prescribed Clindamycin and told to return in three days for drainage. The abscess did not improve or get worse over the three days. I got it drained and was prescribed Augmentin and told to also continue the clindamycin. That was a week ago and the wound is healing well. They called today and said cultures show it was MRSA and they prescribed Bactrim and told me to stop the other antibiotics.I am feeling devastated by this and wanting to understand why it happened. Could I have gotten it in the hospital? I am concerned that it will not go away. Are those swabs at the hospital conclusive and mean for sure I did not have MRSA a month ago? I have never had any medical problems before and these experiences have been very frightening. Is there anything else I can do to prevent recurrence? I have read about everything from bleach baths and hibiclens to antibiotics in the nose.", "output": "\nIt is possible that you could have acquired the MRSA infection in the hospital, although it is difficult to say for sure. The swabs taken at the hospital are not always 100% conclusive, so it is possible that you could have had MRSA at the time of your hospital stay and it was not detected. It is also possible that you acquired the infection after your hospital stay. \n\nTo prevent recurrence, it is important to practice good hygiene, such as washing your hands frequently and avoiding contact with people who have active infections. You can also use an antiseptic soap, such as Hibiclens, to help reduce the risk of infection. Additionally, you may want to consider taking an antibiotic, such as Bactrim, for a few weeks to help prevent recurrence. It is also important to follow up with your doctor regularly to monitor your progress."}

I have been crazily searching to see if this is a result of any swollen lymph node fearing cancer but I could not find anything out of the ordinary on the body. Very rarely I feel this pressure going upwards to the ear and even more rarely a sudden pain arises inside the ear too but I hear no ringing or sounds. The weirdest thing is today I woke up with this sensation and I could feel heaviness behind my ears.This has come after an acute sinus infection, cough, night sweats (for which I had to take antibiotics) that hit me when I started tapering off Lyrica last month. I have had chronic sinus issues in the past too but this one was different, never had it progress to this level. I have uploaded an image of where exactly the pain or pressure originates but right now the pain or pressure is pretty spread out randomly across the neck. Can you please tell me what is going on and what could be the cause of this pain or pressure? Medicines: Although the sinus problem seems to be resolved now I am still taking Loratadine D, Xynosine nasal spray and Librax for IBS related issues.", "output": "\nIt is difficult to say what is causing your pain without a physical examination.

{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,Why some men cannot grow full beards? Explain why some men are not capable of growing full beards, and can only manage thin, patchy ones. Is this due to testosterone and genetics or something more? How does not being able to grow a full beard potentially impact men psychologically? Can this be emasculating for men or cause issues with self-esteem? Is there anything patchy men can do?", "output": "\nThe ability to grow a full beard is largely determined by genetics and testosterone levels. Men with lower levels of testosterone or certain genetic traits may not be able to grow a full beard, and instead may only be able to grow a thin, patchy beard. This can be a source of frustration and low self-esteem for some men, as a full beard is often seen as a sign of masculinity.\n\nThere are a few things that patchy men can do to help improve the appearance of their beard. First, they can use a beard trimmer to even out the length of the beard and make it look more uniform. Second, they can use a beard oil or balm to help soften and condition the beard, making it look fuller and healthier. Finally, they can use a beard brush to help distribute the natural oils in the beard and make it look thicker.\n\nUltimately, it is important for men to remember that the ability to grow a full beard is largely out of their control, and that there is nothing wrong with having a patchy beard.

I have hereditary low blood pressure so that the side effect was not an issue for me. However, after a few days of use, the licorice causes me to develop muscle aches all over my body. Which I assume are due to the reduced potassium levels from the licorice. Is there a better alternative to the licorice? Or a way to prevent the loss of potassium so I can use it for more than a few days at a time?

These include herbs such as ashwagandha, maca, and tribulus terrestris. Additionally, lifestyle changes such as regular exercise, stress management, and adequate sleep can also help reduce libido.\n\nIn order to prevent the loss of potassium, it is important to make sure you are getting enough potassium in your diet.

{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,You were wonderful in allaying some health anxiety over some skin issues several months ago. So, I thought I would consult with you on another question pertaining to my son. Unfortunately, a combination of my health anxiety and the big mistake of searching online has my mind imagining the worst with regard to my son. My son is 19 years old and has no diagnosed medical issues. I noticed back when he was about eight or ten years old that he had a mark resembling a cafe au lait mark on his back, in the upper shoulder area. I had always asked the pediatrician to look at it during his yearly physicals, and they made nothing of it. Throughout the years it has grown a bit and has become darker and more rough in texture. It is probably slightly less than an inch in length and looks like a few small lesions grouped together. Again, I have brought it to the pediatrician\\s attention and he was not concerned. Three months ago, I made an appointment for him and my other son with a dermatologist for a skin exam, and I pointed out the spots which I wanted to be checked in particular. We met with the physician\\s assistant there, and my younger son had a peculiar spot I pointed out, of which the PA conducted a shave biopsy, which came back as a mildly atypical junctional nevus. For my older son, I pointed out the spot on his back/shoulder, and the PA diagnosed it as a linear epidermal nevus. She said the chances of it becoming dangerous are slim to none. It may darken throughout the years, and they will simply monitor it at yearly visits. Unfortunately, I went on to research online about epidermal nevi and of course I ran into information showing a possible link to epidermal nevus syndrome and all of its associated neurological and skeletal defects. As I said, he is 19 and has no medical issues, is extremely intelligent, etc. In your opinion, is it safe to say that I should not be concerned about those syndromes? I presume it is primarily related to the numerous and systemic epidermal nevi, which he does not have, and I would think it would have presented by now? And my last even more neurotic question. My online research led me to some information saying that a certain type of epidermal nevus could be related to a gene mutation that could be passed along to an offspring, with them having possible serious skin scaling conditions, etc. Again, he has just one solitary small epidermal nevus. No biopsy was done, as the PA did not feel it was necessary. Do you feel there is any need for me to worry about that potential genetic mutation? Thank you so much for reading my long query.", "output": "\nIt is highly unlikely that your son has any genetic mutation related to his epidermal nevus. Epidermal nevi are usually benign and do not cause any serious health issues. The chances of it becoming dangerous are slim to none, and it is unlikely that it will cause any serious health issues in the future. It is also unlikely that it will be passed on to any offspring. Therefore, it is safe to say that you should not be concerned about any syndromes or genetic mutations related to the epidermal nevus."}

It is important to address both of these issues in order to get a good night's sleep. First, it is important to establish a regular sleep schedule and stick to it.

I can go even more than 30 times a day - majority of these times, I feel an increased urgency. However, when I go, only a small amount or drops come out. For the past two to three days, the urgency kind of feels to be getting worse, I feel as if I will not be able to hold it. However, I am still able to as there is no leaking. There is no burning or irritation or any discharge. No recent sexual encounters and no other associated symptoms. I take Coveram 10/10 for essential hypertension and Valdoxan 25 because I also do suffer from anxiety. I have been under stress lately as I was doing my exams this past week and finished today. I have done a few tests at my family doctor: Last week I did a dipstick which was normal apart from +1 protein. Voiding bladder US was normal (450 mL pre voiding, 45 mL post voiding). An initial urine culture was normal according to my doctor. Yesterday, I performed another dipstick and urine culture. The dipstick was normal, and early urine microscopy showed 10 to 100 white cell count. We are waiting for the cultures to return. Due to the result of the white cell count, my doctor said it would be worth a try to undergo a 5-day course of antibiotics (Keflex).Today is my third day of antibiotic treatment, symptoms are largely the same. Today, I attempted to hold my bladder. It felt fine in the morning but as the day went on, my symptoms returned and I am finding it harder to hold my bladder. Also, for the first time, I tried going for a run. The entire time I felt a heaviness in my bladder and felt a strong urge to urinate, even though I went before my run began. What do you think could be going on? My doctor believes that it is either a UTI, or most likely, a hypersensitive bladder due to exam stress. However, there have been days where I have not felt stress at all yet symptoms have continued. I am really worried as I want to go back to work in five days and I do not think I will be able to manage the way things are at the moment. My family doctor does think this will settle down now that I have finished exams. Do you think there is a chance it could? I have mentioned this query to another doctor online, and he believed it may be due to an overactive bladder. However, since I am relatively young to receive this diagnosis, I wanted a second opinion, if that is alright. Do you think this could be OAB? I am worried that it could be something serious, like multiple sclerosis. One and a half years ago, I had an episode of sudden onset numbness in one arm and fearing the same thing, I ended up having an MRI of my brain and lumbar spine which both came back negative. Do you think this could be MS?", "output": "\nIt is unlikely that this is due to multiple sclerosis, as the MRI results were negative. It is more likely that this is due to a urinary tract infection or a hypersensitive bladder due to exam stress. It is possible that it could be due to an overactive bladder, but it is more likely that it is due to one of the other two causes. It is possible that the symptoms will settle down now that you have finished exams, but it is also possible that they may persist.

The best way to confirm a diagnosis of pinworms is to have a stool sample tested.

Apple cider vinegar, garlic, and carrots are not effective treatments for pinworms, and drinking them will not cause the worms to come out of your body.

{"instruction": "", "input": "Hi doctor,I have been taking 4 mg of Xanax a day to treat severe panic attack syndrome and associated high levels of general anxiety for 15 years. My doctor arrived at the 4 mg per day amount gradually and it works very well along with CBT from a therapist. Before two months, when I received the medication from the pharmacy it was for 3 mg /day. I asked them to double check and that was the quantity that my doctor had written. I call his office and the office manager said that she would ask him about it. When I called the next day she said that he did not make a mistake and I asked for an explanation and was told that he did not give one.I started to feel sick a few days later and panic attacks actually started to increase the day that I talk to his office manager. I suffered minor but disruptive withdrawal symptoms physically and mentally for about two weeks and then they subsided but panic attacks continued to occur at random every day and my GAD symptoms increased to the point where CBT methods were not working.Then last month, the script was back to 4 mg per day normal dosage.

Question 6 : Various herbs like monolaurin, a coconut ingredient are proven to flush out/kill HSV-1 virus from nerves, how far is this trustworthy? Please explain.", "output": "\n1. It is not necessary to take Acyclovir for a past HSV-1 infection. The IgG test is a marker of past infection, and it is not indicative of an active infection. \n\n2. It is not necessary to retest for HSV-1.\n\n3. HSV-1 is typically transmitted through direct contact with an infected person, such as kissing or sharing utensils. It can also be transmitted through sexual contact.\n\n4. HSV-1 is not a life-threatening disease, but it can cause discomfort and pain.\n\n5. A positive HSV-1 IgG test does not necessarily mean that you were infected 3 or 4 months ago. It could have been longer ago than that.\n\n6. Herbs such as monolaurin have not been proven to flush out or kill HSV-1 virus from nerves. There is no scientific evidence to support this claim."}

It has always been very benign and had a hair growing out of it that I consistently plucked. About two weeks ago, I noticed a small, shiny whiteish bump on the mole and called my dermatologist. Because of the holidays, I could not get an appointment anytime soon and still have another week to wait. Over the last couple of days, the mole has gotten bigger though it has stayed symmetrical and is still slightly smaller than a pencil eraser. It is slightly more raised and it stings to touch. I also realized that it has been a month or two since I had to pluck any hair. None has grown.I have had a zit on this mole a couple times but this does not really look like the previous moles. I am conscious it could be another more severe zit or maybe a cyst but I am very nervous that it is cancer.

It is important to remember that most moles are benign and that the majority of skin cancers are also non-life threatening. However, it is important to have any changes in moles or new moles checked out by a dermatologist. It is also important to practice sun safety and to wear sunscreen and protective clothing when outdoors.\n\nIn the meantime, it is important to keep an eye on the mole and to watch for any changes in size, shape, color, or texture. If you notice any changes, it is important to contact your dermatologist right away. It is also important to keep the area clean and dry and to avoid picking or scratching at the mole.\n\nI hope this helps to ease your worries.

{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,I began presenting last fall with some chronic fatigue. The initial blood work showed low iron saturation without anemia. I have attached reports of the same. There were other endocrine-related findings as well. In the course of various endocrine-related treatments and corresponding blood work, I began iron supplementation in the form of ferrous sulfate 143 mg daily. I began this before the blood work was done. So, you can see that that the levels have increased. Subsequent testing, a month later, showed a decline despite continuing treatment. Most recently, you can see that the levels are back up. Note that the ferritin levels began a bit low around 27 ng/mL and had increased to 30 ng/mL.I have received a wide range of conflicting advice about whether low iron levels in the absence of anemia can cause fatigue. I have also received a range of conflicting advice about whether to continue iron supplementation. One doctor told me to continue taking the iron until the ferritin is up around 50 or so. Another said that would be unnecessary and to discontinue it and wait for three months to re-measure the blood work. It is all quite puzzling. Please help me to understand iron\\s role, if any, in fatigue in the absence of anemia. And help me to then understand the rationale for treatment or lack thereof. And finally, please give me some sense of when iron toxicity emerges in terms of blood work measurements and at what frequency one needs to check the iron levels during any supplementation.", "output": "\nIron is an essential mineral that is necessary for the production of hemoglobin, which is responsible for carrying oxygen throughout the body. Low iron levels can cause fatigue, even in the absence of anemia, as the body is not able to produce enough hemoglobin to transport oxygen efficiently. Iron supplementation can be beneficial in this case, as it can help to replenish the body's iron stores and improve energy levels.\n\nIt is important to monitor iron levels closely when supplementing with iron, as too much iron can lead to iron toxicity. Iron toxicity can cause a range of symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and fatigue. It is recommended to check iron levels every 3-4 months when supplementing with iron, and to adjust the dosage accordingly. It is also important to note that iron levels should not be increased too quickly, as this can also lead to toxicity. The goal should be to slowly increase iron levels over time, with the aim of reaching a ferritin level of 50 ng/mL."}

So, I stopped taking the Clomid in March this year and had my physical last week.The doctor says my testosterone is 570, A1c is 6.0 and everything else looks good. He says since I still have symptoms, that I have testosterone resistance. His analogy was; like diabetics, their bodies produce insulin but just does not know what to do with it.So, his treatment recommendation is TRT testosterone replacement therapy along with Clomid. I am hesitant because I feel this therapy is overused nowadays, and I feel pretty good except my libido.Sought a second opinion today from my urologist, he seemed disinterested in me doing that but said if I try a few injections it would not hurt me, then advised me to run this by an endocrinologist.So I guess in summary:Do you believe that testosterone resistance is a valid diagnosis?If I do try the TRT, can I stop after a few weeks or a few injections and get back to the way I am right now with no permanent issues?Should I just start the Clomid again, or just keep using the Cialis and keep working out and trying to clean up my diet more?Any other thoughts and advise would be appreciated.

About seven months ago, he had an episode of foreign body pain in the eye which the contact lens could not control. His optometrist changed the type of lens after remarking that the lens appeared tight. Although the painful sensations have decreased, they are still present with more of a sore feeling now. His ophthalmologist suggested that he discontinue the Azopt drops he had been using in case the preservative was causing some corneal toxicity. His eye pressure without the drops has read at 18 and 20 on separate occasions, but he does have corneal edema which may affect the measurement. He has had high pressure in that eye previously, but it was mostly lowered by Cyclodiode treatment some eight years ago. The consultant said he had left him on the Azopt drops just as a precaution. My query is that if the bandage lens has worked so well for pain management for 10 years is it possible that it can continue to work? And if the Azopt drops and their preservative had caused some toxic reaction seven months ago, could that still be causing him to feel the discomfort? His consultant suggested out that he could have the eye removed to control the pain, but as he has what he feels is some slight, useful vision in that eye, he does not want to take such a drastic and life-changing step.

I gave warm water and honey, and it has subsided a lot.Sometimes her voice sounds normal, and when she screams or cries, I can still feel her voice is a little hoarse.

She does not have any cold, cough and eats normally.In spite of her hoarse voice, she is taking ice creams and cold stuff. If the hoarseness is due to any serious medical condition, would she have any accompanying symptoms? My main concern is cancer. What would be the symptoms of laryngeal cancer other than hoarseness? She is a very adamant kid and still screams if things do not go her way. Suggest remedies to get rid of hoarseness. Please remove my anxiety towards cancer.", "output": "\nHoarseness in a 2.8 year old is most likely due to a viral infection or irritation from crying. It is very unlikely that it is due to cancer. The most common symptoms of laryngeal cancer are a persistent hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, and a lump in the neck. Other symptoms may include a sore throat, earache, and weight loss. To help get rid of the hoarseness, you can try giving her warm liquids, such as tea or soup, and honey. You can also try using a humidifier in her room to help keep her throat moist. If the hoarseness persists, it is best to take her to the doctor for an evaluation."}
