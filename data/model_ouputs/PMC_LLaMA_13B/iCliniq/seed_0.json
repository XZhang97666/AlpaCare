You had infection of the Epididymis (Epididymitis) following mumps 5 months back and have pain in both the vassal after sex. This is mostly due to infection of the epididymis and Vas. You need to do Semen examination and Semen culture to find out the organisms causing this infection and antibiotics to which they are sensitive to so that you can take appropriate antibiotic as per culture report to eradicate infection. Taking antibiotics like Augmenting and Metronidazole twice daily for 4 weeks will help to eradicate the infection. PMC-LLaMA.",

Nothing hurts or is sore, I just want to know how long I am going to have the brown discharge and if I should be worried or if I should do anything about it?\n\n### Response:Hi, Thanks for the query. The brown discharge can be due to collected blood from the endometrium. Usually during menstrual cycle the endometrium will be thickened and prepared for possible pregnancy. If no pregnancy occurs, the endometrium will be shed as menstrual flow. After taking pills for few months, the endometrium will become thin. So, when you had intercourse, the thin endometrium might have bled. This can be considered as normal. Possibly this will subside soon. If you had intercourse during the fertile period, there is possibility of pregnancy. So, if you miss the expected date of next period, go for pregnancy test once. For more details you can ask me through: http://www.PMC-LLaMA .com/doctors/ Chat Doctor.",

The red dots on your finger pits, cold and throat infection are not specific symptoms of HIV. These are non-specific symptoms seen in many other conditions. The only way to know if you are HIV positive is to get an HIV test done. The window period for HIV to be detected in a blood test is 2-4 weeks. If you have had a negative test at three months, you are most likely not HIV positive. You can get a test done after six months as well. This will conclusively prove if you are HIV positive or negative. Hope this helps.",

But your iron level and other parameters are normal. So you may have hemochromatosis.  You should go for liver biopsy to confirm it.  Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using PMC-LLaMA. Wish you a very good health.",

It is not a life-threatening condition, but it can lead to some complications like infertility and cervical cancer. It is not 100% that it will lead to infertility, but it will definitely increase the chance of getting infertile. So it is better to consult your gynecologist and take proper treatment. Thank you.",

For the past 3 months, I have been experiencing this facial tightness which comes pretty often throughout the day with different intensity. The facial tension usually comes half an hour after I leave the bed. The tightness on my face happens to be on both sides of my face but usually more intense on the right. At times, I can feel it from my neck all the way up to my face. As of recent, I have been feeling this slight burning sensation on my chest to my shoulders as well. Prior to this facial tightness, I have been suffering from this burning feeling on the centre of my chest for about a month. It was my first time experiencing heartburn and I thought it was heart related. Went for X-rays and echo heart ultrasound. Everything came out fine. I have a healthy heart. What made the burning chest sensation go away temporarily is lying down, eating, exercising and drinking alcohol. And the weird part is the same thing helps me relieve my facial tightness temporarily is the same thing as that for the burning chest sensation; lying down, eating, exercising and drinking alcohol.Since having this facial tightness, I have paid numerous visits to different doctors, even the neuro-specialist and they all said it was anxiety. The doctors did facial senses test where they take a piece of fine cotton to touch different parts of my face. I had to close my eyes and tell them where the spot is. I have no troubles at all. I did blood test. It came out normal. They told me I do not need to do any scans and that it was merely anxiety and it will go off by itself. I convinced myself that I had anxiety because of the one month heartburn ordeal that I was suffering from. Even though the facial tightness was there, I tried my utmost best to ignore it. I do not think that I have any anxiety in me now as I try not to think of the weird tightness sensation. However, it has been 3 whole months and now I am getting alarmed and worried that it is still here and with newer sensations as I described above. In all honesty, I do feel that the intensity of the facial tension as compared to I first experienced it, is less. However, it is always there even as when I am typing this.

She also complained that while moving she felt as if she was moving on a bed of soft cotton.Subsequent treatment by neuro experts revealed that overdose of treatment of her TB in abdomen resulted in this condition and she was diagnosed for peripheral neuropathy and was advised for biopsy for proper diagnosis.

It is unfortunate that your mother has suffered so much, and still, there is no complete relief. The main problem seems to be peripheral neuropathy, which is a result of TB infection of the abdomen.

Besides, as she is having pain in the hip, knee, shoulder, back, etc. I will advise to undergo a thorough clinical examination and also an MRI of the knee, hip, spine, etc. to see the soft tissue status. As she is 50, there will be a possibility of the degenerative changes in the body and the pain is the result of it.

The symptoms of headache, dizziness and nausea are due to PPI overuse. It is best to avoid PPI for some time and then take it if required. The symptoms of headache and heaviness might be due to sinusitis or migraine. This requires a clinical examination and if required a CT scan of the brain.

        "input": "Hello doctor,My son has developed anxiety symptoms about four years ago. They came completely out of the blue. He was with someone who now has heart palpitations, sweaty palms and feet, and lightheadedness sitting in the living room. We ran a battery of tests when it first happened including TSH, EKG, lung scans, blood panels, etc. and everything was normal. So we went down the path of anxiety. Four years later, the symptoms continued. As my son now has a terrible fear of doctors, we tried a home blood test to get a full thyroid panel. I have attached the results.The blood work came back normal. Low normal TSH, but low normal T4 and lower normal free T4 and free T3. There is nothing that shows an abnormality. However, his urine test showed moderately low iodine and slightly low selenium. I have read that abnormalities in these measures could cause thyroid problems. What am I wondering is if these two indicators are worth further exploration with an endocrinologist knowing that going to the doctor will cause my son a severe panic.Also, is it possible that low iodine could have been a temporary diet thing and it is masking the signs of hyperthyroidism in the blood work? He has all of the symptoms of someone with hyperthyroidism. On a side note, I am hypothyroid, my sister is hypothyroid and my two nieces had Hashimoto\\s with my younger niece having thyroid cancer and got her thyroid removed at age of 22. So everyone on my side of the family has thyroid issues. We were wondering if you could please give us some guidance. Looking to see if we need to eliminate thyroid as a possible cause of his symptoms or if it is worth further pursuit.",

I have gone through your question in detail and I can understand what you are going through. The symptoms of anxiety are not related to the thyroid levels. The thyroid levels are normal. The anxiety could be a separate illness. You may try paroxetine or clonazepam or propranolol or Escitalopram or fluoxetine. These medicines need to be taken for 8-10 months. Hope I am able to answer your concerns. If you have any further query, I would be glad to help you.

Mometasone is a corticosteroid and is not a treatment of acne. It can only reduce the inflammation of acne. For acne, you need to take oral as well as topical medicines.

Dengue fever can also mimic early pregnancy symptoms. If the pregnancy test is positive, you can get a trans-vaginal sonogram to confirm the gestation and locate the gestation sac. If the test is negative and pregnancy is ruled out, the cause of the spotting should be investigated. Hormone disturbances, infections and local lesions should be excluded. Hope this helps.",

This is because of the high hormone content in the pill. The subsequent hormone disturbances can also cause the delay. If you become overdue by ten days, please see a specialist for further help. Pregnancy should be excluded through a blood test and a trans-vaginal sonogram. If negative, you can induce a period by using progesterone. Hope this helps.",

The fungus is the normal comedians of the genitals which are kept under control by the helpful bacteria, whenever there is an imbalance in the environment it will lead to multiplication of the fungus and produces the symptoms. As you are having the symptoms of fungal infection for which you have taken treatment, but it is not clear whether it is cured completely or not. For your present symptoms I would suggest you to undergo lab investigations like KOH mount, CBC and urine routine examination. For your present symptoms I would suggest you to follow1. Keep the genitals clean and PMC-LLaMA. 2. Topical antifungal cream like ketaconazole3. Single oral dose of Tab Rifleman, 150 mg. Thank you.",

Ovulation occurs two weeks prior to the onset of the next period and this is the fertile period. The pill provides 99 percent protection when taken within the stipulated time interval.

Please see a specialist for further help if you become overdue by ten days. Hope this helps.",

Should I be telling him to get a pancreas MRI done?\n\n### Response:Hi, Thanks for writing in. It is possible that you have a condition called as latent autoimmune diabetes of the adult onset (LADA). This is a condition which is frequently missed as diabetes and is diagnosed in people who appear to have type 1 diabetes but have a less severe form of the condition. This is thought to be an autoimmune condition and is diagnosed by testing for the presence of autoantibodies in the blood. The insulin levels in your blood are not high enough to suggest pancreatic cancer. However, you should get your condition confirmed by doing a glucose tolerance test and then if required an insulin level in the blood. Please do not worry.",

Anxiety and panic attacks can trigger this clinical situation too.  Coming to this point, I would recommend performing an ambulatory 24-48 hours ECG monitoring in order to investigate for possible cardiac arrhythmia and some blood lab tests (complete blood count for anemia, thyroid hormone levels for thyroid gland dysfunction, blood electrolytes for possible imbalance).  If all these tests result normal, you should consider anxiety as the main cause of your complaints.  Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.",

You advised me not to take contraceptive pills since I have the DIU MIRENA. But I have another question. You are right, I have been feeling my body temperature too high, and my last period almosts last seven days. Here is my question: There are five pills left in the blister, and because of your advice I would like to quit right now from taking pills. Is it alright to stop now or should I finish the pills this month and then stop taking them?\n\n### Response:Hi, Thanks for the query. If you are having doubt regarding pregnancy, better to go for blood test for pregnancy once. If the test comes negative, you can stop the pills. If the test comes positive, you have to continue the pills till the end of this month. And after that you can go for regular contraceptive pills. If you want to stop the pills immediately, you can do it now. But the possibility of hormonal imbalance and menstrual irregularity is more in the next few cycles. For more details you can ask me through: http://www.PMC-LLaMA .com/doctors/ Chat Doctor.",

I went to my athletic trainer a month ago, and she told me she thinks it is just an aggravated muscle spasm. So she told me to just give it some rest from the activity that hurt it.

After going through your query I came to know that you are suffering from chronic backache. It may be due to vitamin and trace element deficiencies specially vitamin D and vitamin B 12. You need to do MRI to rule out other causes. Back exercises, neurotrophic such as mecobalamine and analgesics (DICLOFENAC 100 MG SLOW RELEASE TABLETS) give relief. Sometimes vitamin D deficiency can aggravate this so serum vitamin D test is advised if it is lower than vitamin D supplementation will be required. Avoid long continuous standing. Sit in a straight posture. Eat milk, fruits and green leafy vegetables daily. You can discuss with your treating Doctor about it. I do hope that you have found something helpful, and I will be glad to answer any further query. Take care.",

I have gone through your question in detail and I can understand what you are going through. It seems that you are having a depressive episode along with the dysphonia. You need to get treated for the depression. Depression can occur with regular stress, and it can also occur biologically without any stress as well. You need proper treatment for the same. There are various effective therapies for depression like fluoxetine, venlafaxine, bupropion, mirtazapine or Escitalopram, and they are all very effective and mostly safe. You may also require some benzodiazepines like clonazepam or lorazepam for a short period like 2-3 weeks to reduce the anxiety and help with your sleep.  Hope I am able to answer your concerns.

Please help.\n\n### Response:Hello, Welcome to PMC-LLaMA. I have gone through your query, as you are wearing contact lenses since 3 years and sleeping with them, you are at high risk of infection.  Redness of eye is due to infection. I will advise you to remove your contact lenses and consult an ophthalmologist for examination of eye and treatment.  You can use antibiotic eye PMC-LLaMA.  Hope this will help you. Regards",

If it is associated with intercourse, it can be due to :-Hormonal imbalance. -Uterine fibroid. -Adenomyosis. -Pelvic inflammatory disease. -Endometrial polyp. -Cervical erosion.etc. So, once consult gynecologist, get examined and go for ultrasound. This will help in the diagnosis of the cause. Then with your doctors' advice you can go for further investigations and take tablets to control the bleeding. Take care.",

Welcome to PMC-LLaMA . I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. As per your complaint it seems that due to injury there has been severe damage to the tooth and the tooth has become mobile and has moved inside due to loss of attachment and support. There is also bleeding due to injury to the blood vessels that might be leading to profuse bleeding. I would suggest you to consult an Oral Physician and get evaluated and a thorough clinical evaluation and investigations like x-ray can help in diagnosis and treatment can be done accordingly. In case if tooth can be saved then root canal treatment can be done followed by capping of tooth. In case if tooth cannot be saved due to excessive damage then extraction can be done. As of now you can take anti-inflammatory painkillers like Ibuprofen and apply a sterile gauge soaked in saline over the bleeding site. Do cool compresses over the bleeding site. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards. PMC-LLaMA.",

Another factor may be that I used to hold my mobile phone in my pocket all the time.I am a sprint athlete and have defined leg muscles, but this could be due to my short stature. I have gone for another blood test for GH, just as a follow up and that time I was advised to fast for 14 hours. But, I did not fast during my first blood test. Please help me.\n\n### Response:Hello, I understand your concern. I am PMC-LLaMA, infectious diseases specialist, answering your query. In my opinion you should not worry. Your testosterone is normal. Normal testosterone level is between 270 and 1000. Your level is 2100 which is normal. Your HGH is low, but it is not the cause of worry. As you have crossed the age of 18, so your growth plates has already been fused. So there is no question of further growth. Your erectile dysfunction is also not because of this. It is because of psychological problem. I advise you to do regular exercise and yoga. This will help you in maintaining your erection. I will be happy to answer your further concern, you can ask me on bit.ly/ PMC-LLaMA.  Thank you. ChatDoctorInfectious diseases specialist.",

The area above the belly button is a sensitive area and can have nerves passing through. It is possible that you are having a mild nerve entrapment in the area. This can cause pain and discomfort. The muscle repair is a small surgery and does not usually cause much pain. The pain is more in the first 24 hours and then it decreases. The liposuction is also a painless procedure, but you might be having a mild bulge in the area above the belly button. This is because of the muscle repair and not due to any complication. Please take rest and apply ointments containing muscle relaxant and pain reliever. Please do not worry.",

Stress may flare the lesions.  You consult dermatologist for firm diagnosis. You may take tab.isotretinoin 20 mg daily for few months. Or you may take 20 mg dose at 15 days interval. After control of acne, you may take vitamin C tab. Or you may apply vitamin C cream locally. To improve the pigmentation. You may apply clindamycin gel on the lesions. And you may take tab. Doxycycline daily. You may apply sunscreen gel like sun mask aqua gel. And you may use moisturizer like detail moisturizing lotion. You should avoid oily food. And you should take healthy food. You should avoid stress. And you should take proper sleep. I hope you got my answer. Thanks.",

The commonest cause of heavy periods is fibroids in the uterus. Other causes include endometrial hyperplasia, endometrial cancer, polyps in the uterus, thyroid disorders, bleeding disorders, etc. I would suggest that you get a transvaginal sonogram done to look for the cause of heavy periods. If you are in the reproductive age group, then you should also get an endometrial biopsy done. If you are postmenopausal, then you should get a D and C done to look for endometrial cancer. Further management depends on the cause of heavy periods. Hope this helps. Please reply for further queries. Wishing you good health.",

My question is what is the real answer, can I beat the virus and remove it from my body completely leaving only anti-bodies?\n\n### Response:Hi, Thanks for posting in PMC-LLaMA. I understand your concern. Hepatitis B is a viral infection caused by hepatitis B virus. It is a major global health problem and a significant cause of chronic liver disease. Most individuals who get infected with hepatitis B virus clear the virus from the blood and body fluids within a few months. However, some individuals (about 3-4%) develop chronic hepatitis B infection and carry the virus for life. They are called as carriers. They are responsible for transmission of infection to others. In your case, you have tested positive for hepatitis B core antibody. This means that you have been exposed to the virus, but not that you have chronic hepatitis B infection. You need to get the following tests done to confirm whether you have chronic hepatitis B infection or not: 1. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) 2. Hepatitis B E antigen (HBeAg) 3. Hepatitis B viral load (HBV DNA) 4. Liver function test. Kindly consult Physician or Gastroenterologist with the report for appropriate management. Hope the information provided would be helpful. All the best.",

The pain on the right side of the abdomen for the last 3 days which increases on pressure and is not very severe and comes and goes indicates that it is most probably due to colitis. I would advise you the following:Take a course of an antibiotic and metronidazole and probiotic for 5 days. If there is complete relief, nothing to worry about. If there is no relief, you need to undergo the following tests:Blood-routine and WidalUrine and stool tests in details. Ultrasonography of the abdomen. Colonoscopy if the medical treatment fails to give you relief."

As you have plantar fasciitis, and already taken steroid injections and MRI done, I will advise you to undergo physical therapy. As with therapeutic ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy the inflammation and pain can be reduced.

In my clinical practice, most patients respond well to physical therapy and rehabilitation of the foot. RegardsJay In PMC-LLaMA.",

If possible get in blood examination for insulin level in blood. As I have seen in many cases that even after normal blood sugar level patient feels tiredness, loss of weight and other symptoms. So please get in blood examination for insulin level. 2 As far as thyroid is concerned, all parameters are within normal limit. But if you feel any symptoms like, loss of weight, weakness, tremors in hands, palpitation, then consult a physician and get his opinion. 3 Vitamin D level is also normal. But if you feel any symptoms of vitamin D deficiency like, bone pain, bone fracture, muscle weakness, then consult an orthopedic and get his opinion. In my opinion all reports are normal and need not worry. Good luck.",

I have been stressing out badly due to the fact I have been on Lorazepam 1 mg every night for anxiety and PD for the last 2 years as well as Percocet 10 mg as needed for back pain.

I also tried not taking the Lorazepam at all and woke up crying, shaking and sweating.

Enamel was removed to make room for the composite resin and the enamel is now too thin and feels sharp to the tongue\\s touch because of this. Shape and feel is not consistent with the natural front right tooth. Is there any way to fix this? Want to be as conservative as possible to avoid further damage.\n\n### Response:Hello, I can understand your concern. Dental bonding is a procedure in which a tooth colored resin material is applied over the tooth and then the surface is shaped and polished to give a natural look. However, if the enamel layer is thinned out too much, then the material used for bonding may not be able to give a natural look. In addition, if the bonding material is not applied properly, then it may not give a natural look. I would advise you to visit a cosmetic dentist or a prosthodontist for the examination of the tooth and the bonding material. The dentist may remove the material and redo it to give you a natural look. If the bonding material is damaged, then it can be repaired. If the enamel is too thin, then you may have to go for veneers to cover the tooth. I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing PMC-LLaMA. Take care. Best,",

The x-rays you have attached show that the roots of the milk tooth are very close to the roots of the permanent tooth that is going to erupt in the area. In this scenario, the milk tooth is not going to stay for long, and it will fall out soon. In addition, the roots of the milk tooth are very close to the permanent tooth roots and if the milk tooth is not removed, it might cause damage to the roots of the permanent tooth while it is falling out. Therefore, the dentist is advising you to get the milk tooth extracted. I would advise you to go with the dentist's advice as it is for the betterment of the permanent tooth in the future. I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing PMC-LLaMA. Take care. Best,",

Now, my wife is again pregnant and has completed 26 weeks of pregnancy. She has developed antibodies and the latest ICT with titer test results show 1:64. Last week, we also did sonography and that did not have any impact on the baby.Now, the doctor suggests giving some steroids in this week which will help to develop the baby\\s lungs faster to prevent any complication. Is it safe? If my baby\\s blood group is also negative then are there any possibilities for antibodies to develop in my wife or does the baby\\s blood group does not matter at all? Should I go ahead with NIPT to find the baby\\s blood group?\n\n### Response:Hi, Thanks for asking.  I understand your concern.  * Steroid injection to mother is given to prevent lung problems in baby. The injection is given only when mother has developed antibodies in high titer (1:64 is not high).  * Baby blood group is important for mother to be advised steroid injection.  * Mother is advised to take steroid injection if babies blood group is also negative.  * Mother is advised to take steroid injection if babies blood group is also negative.  * You can go ahead with NIPT to find babies blood group.  Thanks.",

I have been diagnosed with WPW accidentally, and I am waiting for an ablation in 17 days. I am mostly asymptomatic, and I never had any extremely rapid heart rates. My resting heart rate is actually in the 40\\s. However, I do sometimes get palpitations and every once in awhile get a run of 5 to 7 in a row.

I have not had any palpitations since I began taking it a few days ago, but I want to make sure this drug is not putting me at risk for creating a dangerous rhythm. Reading case studies and medical journals, it seems there is some risk. I have not been known to go into AF, and besides palpitations, I am asymptomatic with WPW.

HMD is characterized by progressive central vision loss. The impact of the disease on a person varies from person to person. Some people with HMD retain good central vision throughout their lives, while others with the same condition may lose all central vision in one or both eyes. HMD does not make a person completely blind.",

I am under Macfolate and Metformin tablets for the past seven months. I have regular periods for the past six months. This month, on the 11th day, I missed my period. After two days, when I checked for pregnancy, I got a negative result. Again after seven days, I got a negative result after checking for pregnancy. I am getting mucus discharge in small amounts. It does not have any foul odor. Am I pregnant? Why is it showing negative?\n\n### Response:Hi, I think you should do a urine pregnancy test at home after one week.  Sometimes it can take time for the pregnancy test to come positive.  If negative wait for your periods.  If positive consult a doctor.  Do a thyroid profile and prolactin levels and an ultrasound for your uterus and ovaries to find out the cause of irregular periods.  If negative and periods don't come after 10 days, you can take some medicines for inducing periods.  Hope I have answered your question. Regards PMC-LLaMA.",

The wisdom tooth oozes green pus if you apply pressure with a cotton swab. The decayed tooth is mildly painful. I saw my dentist a few days ago, who did not seem overly concerned. She slightly cleaned the gums around the wisdom tooth and prescribed me Cephalexin and sent me on my way. I have been taking Cephalexin for a few days, and yet the tooth is still oozing. My throat is red and irritated, the gums inflamed and there is no swelling in the mouth. Also, my nostril on that side is tender and painful. I am severely worried about the infection spreading to either my heart or my brain. In fact, I read an article a few days ago about a 26 year old who died from a tooth infection spreading.I do not have a fever. I have mild nausea. It is tender on that side of my jaw. The dentist had said the next thing she could give me was Clindamycin, but I have a fear of the side effects of that medicine. I already have heart problems and mild stomach issues. I have read that Clindamycin can cause severe gastrointestinal problems and arrhythmias. She also suggested Zithromax, but I have had heart palpitations while on that medication as well.

There are no signs of it from the last one year. However, she has these bulging eyes all the time, but she can perfectly see everything with her spectacles. I do not really know what happened to her the other day. She was watching her favorite TV show and all of sudden, her right eye popped out of her eye socket and she started shouting. It was such a scary and frightening situation where I and my dad did not know what to do and out of nowhere, my dad suddenly pushed her eye with a little pressure and the eye was back in its position as usual. My mom experienced severe pain after this incident when she was rushed to an Ophthalmologist. The doctor had no clue about the reason for her eye pop out. However, I advised her to go through a few medical tests and the results are yet to come. Meantime, I just want to understand why this happened to her and will this happen regularly and what is the treatment needed to prevent this from happening again. I just do not want to think of any situation where she is alone in the home and the same happens to her. I just want her to be completely cured from this one. Please help me with my query.\n\n### Response:Hello, I can understand your concern. It is very difficult to understand what exactly happened from the description you have given. It is possible that the eye was protruding for a long time and the eye muscles were weak. One day, the eye might have become so weak that it popped out of the socket. However, the eye is attached to the socket with tough ligaments and muscles and the eye socket has a bony rim that prevents the eye from falling out. When the pressure of the bony rim was applied, the eye was pushed back into the socket. It is also possible that the eye was protruding due to swelling of the tissues around the eye and the pressure pushed the eye back into the socket. It is also possible that the eye was protruding due to swelling of the tissues around the eye and the pressure pushed the eye back into the socket. The treatment for this condition is to strengthen the eye muscles. This can be done by eye exercises. I would advise you to visit an ophthalmologist for the treatment. I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing PMC-LLaMA. I wish your mother feels better soon. Best,",

It is caused by enlarged adenoids or tonsils or both. It is not dangerous but may lead to daytime sleepiness and poor school performance. You may try Flonase but it does not have any effect on growth. Tonsillectomy is the treatment of choice. It may be done at any age depending on the condition. Hope this answer serves your purpose.

Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15\u00a0mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500\u00a0mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol. Meftal-P contains Metonymic acid which is a NSAID. It carries the risk of gastritis and renal problems in the long run. Please do not use Metal. Hope my answer was helpful for you.  I am happy to help any time. Further clarifications and consultations on PMC-LLaMA are welcome. If you do not have any clarifications, you can close the discussion and rate the answer",

The brown discharge after menses is called as old endometrial discharge. It usually lasts for 2-3 days.  The bad smell you had after your menses was mostly due to vaginal infection.  You should have taken care of it by- - cleaning the vagina with salt water (lukewarm) twice a day for 5 days.  - using cotton panties.  - avoiding sex till the infection is cured.  - using vaginal pH balancing solutions like vaginal boric acid capsules.  - taking antibiotics (to be had after gynecologists consultation) Thanks.",

If she does not have any further bleeding for a couple of weeks after this, she should go for a proper evaluation by an expert. She may need a trans-vaginal/pelvic sonogram and a course of hormones to correct the situation. Hope this helps.",

The test will be positive in both the forms of HIV infection, the acute infection and the chronic infection. The test will be positive in the patients with AIDS. The test is negative in the patients with HIV infection. The test is negative in the patients with HIV infection. The test is not a confirmatory test for HIV infection. The test is used as a screening procedure for the diagnosis of HIV infection. The confirmatory test for the diagnosis of HIV infection is the HIV culture and the HIV PCR test. Thank you.",

        "input": "Hello doctor,I have an anal fissure, internal hemorrhoid, SRUS, and constipation. One year ago, I was suffering from a hard stool that was difficult to pass. I went to a gastroenterologist, who did a colonoscopy and found that I had an anal fissure and internal hemorrhoid. He prescribed Sitcom Forte, Eldicet, Velgut, and Pankreoflat. He also gave me Sucralcoat Ano cream. However, every night I was in too much pain. So, early this year, I decided to consult an Ayurveda doctor who gave me some Kashayams and tablets. However, my pain did not subside. I used to evacuate the stools using my fingers. That eliminated the stools, but there was so much mucus released and extreme pain after motion. Two months ago, I went to a GP who gave me some antibiotics and painkillers for five days. During this time, I was always sleepy. I took leave from work and was always tired and fatigued.

One year ago, I was suffering from a hard stool that was difficult to pass. I went to a gastroenterologist, who did a colonoscopy and found that I had an anal fissure and internal hemorrhoid. He prescribed Sitcom Forte, Eldicet, Velgut, and Pankreoflat. He also gave me Sucralcoat Ano cream. However, every night I was in too much pain. So, early this year, I decided to consult an Ayurveda doctor who gave me some Kashayams and tablets. However, my pain did not subside. I used to evacuate the stools using my fingers. That eliminated the stools, but there was so much mucus released and extreme pain after motion. Two months ago, I went to a GP who gave me some antibiotics and painkillers for five days.

If you will be pregnant then still you can terminate the pregnancy by abortion pill under the advice of gynecologist. But I think you will not need all these as period will come in time.

It is 2:16 PM now and I have a few urgent questions:Should she take the morning after pill?How effective will the morning after pill be in protecting from pregnancy?How much will the pills previously taken lower the risk of pregnancy?Given her current stage of ovulation, what is the risk of her becoming pregnant? The period of time between the missed pill at 8 AM this morning and the time that she will take the morning-after pill (around 4 PM)?Do you recommend taking today's pill today if she is also taking the morning after pill today?Is there anything else we can do now to minimize the risk?Should we be worried?Thank you.",

I have gone through your query and would like to offer some suggestions. If she has been taking the pill regularly, she is well protected. There is no need for the emergency contraception. However, since she missed a pill, she needs additional protection. She can take the emergency contraceptive pill, but, the earlier one, within 72 hours of the unprotected intercourse, is more effective. The emergency contraceptive pill is to be taken only once. It is effective for 72 hours after the unprotected intercourse. Since she is in the ovulation phase, the chances of conception are high. Please get further help from your health care provider. Hope this helps.",

As per your age and history there is possibility of soft tissue injury in knee. Most commonly meniscus injury occurs may be associated collateral ligament injury. If pain persists then you may need to do MRI knee to see for any functional defect. As per your symptoms you need to do physiotherapy and knee exercises to improve range of motion. Rest and ice fomentation along with supportive brace will help to reduce swelling and pain. Small meniscus tear can be managed conservatively with physiotherapy with USG and TENS. Meniscus injury can be managed by arthroscopic repair. Hope this answers your query. If you have additional questions or follow-up queries then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your queries. Wishing you good health. Take care.",

DHT is a hormone that is converted from testosterone in the body. It is not possible to apply testosterone or DHT topically because they cannot penetrate the skin and reach the bloodstream. Therefore, the only way to increase DHT levels is to inject it or take oral medications. The use of testosterone or DHT is associated with many side effects including acne, oily skin, hair loss, aggressive behavior, increased aggression, increased anger, increased risk of prostate cancer, liver toxicity, and heart problems. It is not advisable to use these hormones without a prescription from a doctor. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.",

This is done by using a part of the intestine and making it into a pouch which is then made to function like the bladder. This is a major surgery and requires weekly washes with bicarbonate solution to prevent mucus formation and stone formation. This is a lifelong requirement, and you must continue doing it. There is no alternative to the bicarbonate washes. Please do not worry.",

Based on your query, my opinion is as follows.1. Yes, iron deficiency can occur in people with minor beta thalassemia.2. Due to increased turnover of red blood cells, iron is lost in urine and feces. This leads to iron deficiency.3. Improve your diet. Take iron rich foods like fish, egg, green leafy vegetables, etc. Take It C regularly. It will help in improving iron absorption.4.

I have gone through your query and would like to offer some suggestions. Firstly, you cannot get pregnant with a single act of unprotected intercourse if you are in the safe period of your menstrual cycle. Ovulation occurs two weeks prior to the onset of the next period and this is the fertile phase of the cycle. Secondly, the pill provides ample protection when taken within the stipulated time interval. The pill contains high hormone doses and this can cause a transient hormone imbalance. This is the cause of the with PMC-LLaMA.  The next natural period may get delayed by a week or two. Please see a specialist if you become overdue by ten days for further management. Hope this helps.",

If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15\u00a0mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500\u00a0mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol. Regards -",

Last week after almost two years of not having a UTI I felt the horrible symptoms again. When going to the doctors UTI urine test came back positive. The doctor prescribed me seven days Nitrofurantoin antibiotics which cleared the pain and seemed gone entirely. Unfortunately two days later, the symptoms came back (please note that I had sex with my partner the day before) with burning sensation when urinating and painful when standing with the need to go toilet every 2 to 3 minutes. I went back to the clinic the same day to get it checked and take more antibiotics.But to my surprise, the urine test came back clear for UTI, and my symptoms disappeared. Then the doctor advised me to get tested for Chlamydia as the symptoms can sometimes be mistaken to be UTI. I have been diagnosed with Chlamydia at the beginning of this same relationship and was treated for it. My partner was also tested, but his results came back negative. Is it possible that the treatment that I had for Chlamydia 8 years ago did not clear it entirely and this lead to several UTIs and kidney infections?

And also, would the antibiotics for UTI clear Chlamydia? Thank you in advance for your help.\n\n### Response:Hi, Thanks for posting in PMC-LLaMA. I understand your concern. Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common condition encountered in day to day clinical practice. It is caused by microorganisms that are normally found in the gastrointestinal tract and in the periurethral area. Any condition that causes alteration in the normal defense mechanism of the urinary tract would predispose to UTI. Chlamydia is one such microorganism that can cause UTI. It is one of the common causes of UTI, especially in sexually active young adults. The antibiotics used to treat UTI are usually effective in eradicating the infection. However, in case of Chlamydia, the antibiotics used for UTI would not be effective. Azithromycin or Doxycycline are the antibiotics that are usually prescribed for Chlamydia. In your case, since you have been treated for Chlamydia in the past, it is unlikely that the symptoms you are having now are due to recurrence of Chlamydia. It is more likely that you are having UTI now. Kindly get a urine culture and sensitivity test done to identify the causative organism and get appropriate antibiotics prescribed. Hope the information provided would be helpful. All the best.",

After emergency contraceptive pills, some amount of menstrual irregularity is common. So your symptoms can be due to that.

So you once consult gynecologist, get examined and go for ultrasound. If there is any abnormality in the uterus, you may need hormonal pills for some months to regularize the periods.

It is not serious and does not affect your vision. But if you see a sudden shower of floaters, it can be due to a retinal tear or detachment. In that case, you need to see an ophthalmologist immediately. If you are not seeing any floaters, but only the smudge, you need not worry.

As you have pain radiating from the buttocks to the calf and thigh, it could be related to the pinched nerve in the lumbar spine. As the MRI is normal, it is good to hear that. Also, undergoing physical therapy like therapeutic ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy should help reduce the pain and inflammation. Exercise on a later stage should help improve the strength and muscle re-education. In my clinical practice, patients with similar complaints are referred to physical therapy, and they respond well.

If your child has swallowed the mascara wand, it is most likely that the wand is present in the stomach and will pass out of the body in few days through feces. However, if the wand is present in the mouth and around the mouth, it is possible that it may cause irritation of the mucosa of the mouth and cause ulcers. In that case, you can visit a dentist or a pediatrician for the examination of the area. If any ulcer is present, it can be treated with local application of Endocrine gel (McCoppin) over the ulcer. I would also advise you to visit a dentist for the examination of the area around the mouth of your child as some wand particles may still be present there and can cause irritation and ulceration.

It lasts a second or two but may repeat several times before stopping in five minutes or so. I went out in the garden today to dig a bit and wearing my HR monitor (I have got health anxiety, anxiety disorder as well as depression).

I tried a statin but the muscle pain was too great. In my EKG I have RBBB or LAFB which 14 years back after a stress test I was told that I was probably born with it. I had gone to see the cardiologist then because of getting skipped beats and GERD he told me to ignore them.

Since you are having depression, anxiety and panic disorder, possibility of worsening of these diseases is more for your chest pain. But better to rule out heart diseases first. So get done ECG, 2d echo and stress test. If all these are normal then no need to worry about heart diseases. Your HR is also normal. So possibility of heart diseases is less. Your chest pain is mostly due to worsening of anxiety and panic disorder. So consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on its solution. You may need additional anxiolytic PMC-LLaMA.  Don't worry, you will be alright.

I studied your problem in depth and I understood your concerns. Treatment for small white scar on lower lip-In my opinion you should not be concerned much about it, as it would resolve on its own with time, as it's a normal part of the healing process of the lower lip. So don't worry and take no treatment unless it grows in size and causes esthetic issues. So keep the scar clean and moist with antiseptic cream till it heals up. For Final Diagnosis and treatment, you should consult ER Surgeon. And hence for further treatment I would advise you to Consult ER Surgeon, who would treat it accordingly. This advice is based on the facts from the history you give and needs further clinical check.Hence, I would advise you to check with ER Surgeon. So don't build up wrong concepts and create more psychic complications in you which would increase risks and costs to you. Hope this would relieve your problem.

So don't worry and take no treatment unless it grows in size and causes esthetic issues. So keep the scar clean and moist with antiseptic cream till it heals up. For Final Diagnosis and treatment, you should consult ER Surgeon. And hence for further treatment I would advise you to Consult ER Surgeon, who would treat it accordingly. This advice is based on the facts from the history you give and needs further clinical check.Hence, I would advise you to check with ER Surgeon. So don't build up wrong concepts and create more psychic complications in you which would increase risks and costs to you. Hope this would relieve your problem. Welcome for any more query in this regard to PMC-LLaMA. Write good resume and Click thanks if you feel satisfied with my advice. Have a Good Day. PMC-LLaMA. N."

A thorough musculoskeletal assessment is advised. As you had a fracture of fibula in the past and now you had a fall on the same ankle, I will advise to undergo an x-ray first. As the mechanism of injury was a fall and twist, there might be a ligament sprain or a muscle strain. But x-ray will help to understand the bony status. Also, if the x-ray turns negative than an MRI will be advised to understand the soft tissue status. As you are not able to walk or bear weight it could be a ligament injury. Undergoing physical therapy like - therapeutic ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy should help reduce the pain and swelling. Also, exercises on a later stage should help regain the strength and ROM. In my clinical practice such cases are recommended for physical therapy, and they respond well. RegardsJay In PMC-LLaMA.",

Good thing is that you have already done x-ray and ultrasound which have come out to be normal. I would suggest you to get a urine routine examination done to rule out urinary infection which is a common cause of abdominal pain in child PMC-LLaMA.  If it comes out to be normal then I would suggest you to give her syrup Cyclops 5 ml PO three times a day for 3 days and syrup Cyclops 5 ml PO three times a day for 3 days. This will help in reducing the pain. Also, I would suggest you to give her a probiotic like enterogermina ampule once a day for 3 days. I hope this helps. Take care.",

The abnormal sensations that you have such as burning, tingling are termed peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral Neuropathy is a condition caused by damage to the peripheral nervous system [most commonly seen in diabetic patients]. Another possibility could be nerve compression in spine due to disc bulge. Change your diet and remove inflammatory foods such as citrus fruits, dairy products and wheat that may aggravate the condition. Simultaneously increase your intake of potassium and calcium-rich foods such as bananas and avocados and green leafy vegetablesVitamin B12 is important in the maintenance of health and normal functioning of the nerve tissue and deficiency of it can lead to numbness. You can increase B12 level by taking meat and fish, or you can take tab methylcobalamine. I do hope that you have found something helpful, and I will be glad to answer any further query. Take care",

It started over last winter when I applied moisturizer. Even after I stopped applying the moisturizer it is peeling still. I went to a doctor and he gave me a vitamin tablet. But, I did not get any cure with that. Then I visited a dermatologist and he gave me Tacrolimus ointment 0.1% and no improvement with that too. Now he has given me the same ointment along with tablets Medrol, Biotin and Celin. Now I feel it has progressed to my upper lip also. Could you please tell me how to cure this? I am so desperate for this to be over. I am under lot of stress because of this. By the way the time when it started, I was under stress. I have searched in internet and I found that many people have been having this problem for many years. Some cured with anxiety medication and some by leaving alone. What shall I do for this?\n\n### Response:Hi, Welcome to PMC-LLaMA. Peeling of lips could be due to causes like deficiency of iron and vitamin B12, anemia, PMC-LLaMA.  You need to get evaluated for these causes. You could take supplements containing vitamin B12 and iron. You could also take multivitamin supplements. Apply moisturizing lotion on lips. Avoid exposure to sun. If there is associated itching, you could take antihistamine like levocetrizine. If there is no improvement, you could get a biopsy done to find out the exact cause. Hope this helps. Regards",

Pre-auricular pits are congenital malformations that are remnants of the first and second branchial clefts. They are lined by squamous epithelium and contain hair follicles.

The testes are supplied by the testicular artery which is a branch of the abdominal aorta. The testicular artery carries oxygenated blood to the testes.

This will not cause mutation in the sperms but can lead to reduced sperm production. The spermatogonia are located in the basal part of the seminiferous tubules and are supplied by the blood. There is no direct effect of reduced blood supply to the testes on the spermatogonia cells. However, reduced testicular blood flow can lead to reduced production of sperm cells and this can cause infertility. Please do not worry.",

Three years ago I once went to the hospital because I felt my heart was beating really fast, and they did some EKG scans and a blood test on me saying that everything is normal. They also gave me the Holter monitor and when they checked the results they said this was normal. I do not smoke or drink alcohol maybe three times a year I will drink. I used to do some shisha but that has stopped for the past three years.Since then I have never been to a hospital for the health of my heart. However, since then, my heartbeat has just been higher than everyone else but I do not get headaches or any other symptoms. I used to stress a lot. However, things are going well now and it has cut down. I wake up at times during the night but fall back asleep very easily. I have done gym and dance classes for over a year and I feel fine when working out.I went to the GP just a week ago due to my girlfriend having some concerns. I asked them to do a regular check and they said my heartbeat at that moment was 98 and he said this was fine. However, my girlfriend gets really worried about this and feels that something will happen to me. She just needs some medical advice in order to get her the assurance.

It is not tachycardia or arrhythmia. It is perfectly normal. You should check your heart rate during your visit to GP. If it is 98 bpm then it is normal.

Dietary changes include increasing fiber intake and avoiding certain foods that cause discomfort. Stress management includes relaxation techniques like yoga and meditation.

Read the history about your Mother and understood the problems. Abdominal tuberculosis, duodenum stricture, obstruction in the recto-sigmoid colon and distal sigmoid colon can be treated only by a multidisciplinary team approach. Surgery may be needed to get a proper diagnosis by biopsy, to get a proper treatment with anti-tubercular treatment, to get a proper diet and to get a proper care for the general health. I would advise you the following:Get her admitted to the hospital. Get the investigations of the blood, urine and stool. CT scan of the abdomen. Diagnostic Laparoscopy to see the extent of the disease and to take a biopsy. Surgery to correct the stricture and obstruction. Proper care for the general health. Proper treatment with anti-tubercular treatment.",

The vaginal opening is of a small size in few women, and it can cause pain during intercourse. This is not a serious condition and can be easily treated. You can use lubricants before having sex to reduce the friction and pain. Also, you can ask your husband to be slow and gentle during intercourse. Foreplay can also help in getting you aroused and lubricate the vagina naturally. If you are still in doubt then do get examined by your gynecologist and discuss the problem. A small surgical procedure can be done to increase the size of the vaginal opening. This is a simple surgery and will help you. Please do not worry.",

After going through your query I came to know that your mother is suffering from chronic backache. It may be due to vitamin and trace element deficiencies specially vitamin D and vitamin B 12. You need to do MRI to rule out other causes. Back exercises, neurotrophic such as mecobalamine and analgesics (DICLOFENAC 100 MG SLOW RELEASE TABLETS) give relief. Sometimes vitamin D deficiency can aggravate this so serum vitamin D test is advised if it is lower than vitamin D supplementation will be required. Avoid long continuous standing. Sit in a straight posture. Eat milk, fruits and green leafy vegetables daily. You can discuss with your treating Doctor about it. I do hope that you have found something helpful, and I will be glad to answer any further query. Take care.",

The best treatment option for stretch marks is the use of lasers. Various types of lasers like Fractional CO2 laser, Non-ablative RF, Nd:YAG laser, etc. can be used.

The bleeding after 5 years of amenorrhea could be due to- - Hormonal imbalance after menopause.  - Uterine pathology like fibroid/ endometrial polyp/ malignancy.  * vaginal infection with blood stained discharge.  * cervical erosion/ polyp.  * Pregnancy (in case she had contact with semen in last 6 months) * Bleeding from urethra/ bladder needs to be ruled out in case of post menopausal bleeding.  * Cervical cancer needs to be ruled out in case of post menopausal bleeding.  * Blood coagulation disorders need to be investigated for.  * Thyroid function tests need to be done to exclude hypothyroidism.  * USG lower abdomen/ vaginal examination/ PAP smear followed by hormonal study/ biopsy as per need.  * Hysterectomy is advised in case of malignancy.  * Hormonal replacement therapy is advised as per need.  * In case of vaginal infection antibiotics/ anti-inflammatory pessaries are advised.  * In case of cervical polyp/ erosion",

No, emphysema can not be diagnosed by chest x-ray or CT scan. For diagnosis of emphysema, PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) is must. It will not only diagnose emphysema, but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. You will need inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or albuterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone). Don't worry, you will be alright with all these.

It is white color although, the one on the top started to have a slight pink color. But the second one on the bottom which is much smaller still has completely white color and around the vagina blades, I have a little while dots. Also, there are very tiny warts line along the blades. So, when I went to see the GP near my house he had a look and said that there is nothing to worry it is still small. But in my opinion, I think it is quite big. So the doctor gave me a prescription for Condyline paint which he told me to use for three days only per week and I have to keep using it for three weeks and if it does not get better he told me to see him again. Now I have a few questions. Is this mean I have an HPV virus inside my body? How can I make the virus go away permanently? Will Gardasil injection make it go away? If it does not go away permanently, how can I make sure that I have no HPV viruses and so these warts will not come back again? Is this mean that I have this HPV from my boyfriend? How to use Condyline paint correctly? I wash my vagina blades and use the cotton pads to dry it, then I use start to use the Condyline paint. I only dip the swab once into the reagent and then I open my vagina blades so that I am able to paint the two warts inside my vagina as much as I can. Then I paint it all over the very tiny warts in the vagina blades area. Am I doing it correctly?Now I have been using the Condyline for two days, but the very tiny warts that are around the vagina blades started to grow more. Is this mean anything? Can condoms prevent these HPV viruses? If I break up with my boyfriend, will this help my symptoms and health to become better? I am very scared of whether this can leads to cancer? I do not want this to ever happen to me again, how can I prevent this to happen again?If my warts are gone can I have sex with my boyfriend? Will these symptoms comeback again?

Once the wart is cleared by topical application of cream you will become free from infection. It is transmitted to your partner, if you indulge in unprotected sexual activity during the presence of lesion. Once the wart is cleared by the topical medicines you can have normal sexual activity, and you will be non-infectious.5% McQuade cream should be applied over the wart on alternate days for 4 months. Before application of this cream you need to apply Vaseline over the wart, and then you have to apply the McQuade cream.Meanwhile you have to boost up your immunity which helps to clear your wart. To boost the immunity you need to take orally capsule Lincoln, daily for 30 days. Thank you.",

I came back with an injured knee and felt dazed. I was fine after around two hours. The next day, I felt pressure in my head and as though I was about to die. I then could not recall getting home or the rest of the night. I was fine in the morning. Two days later, I felt horrendous pain in my head, felt like I was swimming, then tried to go home and again could not recall from deciding to go home to around two hours later and I was foggy for the rest of the night. I have had constant pain in the left side of my head above the temple for four years. It does not go. However, In the past two weeks, I have felt like it is throbbing and at times about to burst out. I was meant to see my neurologist three months back, but his receptionist did not follow the recommendation, and now I am unsure whether to have the tests done. I feel like we are playing with my life. Usually, I am pretty relaxed about the possibilities and know it is a migraine. But this feels different. This feels like intense throbbing above my ear from the temple along towards the back of my head, with a pain in my ear to just behind my jaw under my ear. My instinct says that an aneurysm needs ruling out. I do not know if I am just upset because it feels so different and this pressure is intense. It is a weird feeling. I currently take Sumatriptan as needed.Please, can you advise what to do?

Based on the description, the most likely cause of your symptoms could be migraine. However, it is important to exclude brain aneurysm, as you have suggested.

Donating egg won't cause breast or ovarian cancer. It won't affect your fertility also.  So, you can donate egg once.  You will conceive in the future. But you should take treatment for conceiving.  You should take ovulation inducing PMC-LLaMA.  This will help multiple follicles to mature and rupture. Thus increasing chances of pregnancy.  You should get your follicular study done to know you are ovulating or not.  You should also get your tubal patency done.  If tubes are patent then you can conceive naturally.  If tubes are blocked then you may need to go for IVF. Hope I have been helpful. Regards",

A CT scan is a low dose radiation procedure and the amount of radiation is measured in milli-sieverts. The radiation dose from two CT scans of chest, abdomen and pelvis is approximately 8 mSv. This is a low dose and will not cause any significant risk of cancer. The radiation dose from natural environment is approximately 3 mSv per year and this increases by 1 mSv if you live near a nuclear power plant. Therefore, the radiation dose from the CT scan is not a concern. Please do not worry.",

It is important to know that after a breast abscess, the breast is usually tender and painful for a few days. The swelling will take time to disappear. It is not necessary that you will have to do an I and D. The breast abscess is a localized infection and will not spread to other areas. The pus is a collection of dead white blood cells and bacteria. It is not possible for it to come out by hand expressing. You can feed your baby and there is no problem with the baby. The pus will not affect the baby. Please continue to apply warm compresses and take antibiotics. The swelling will take time to disappear.",

IntraLASIK, also known as Bluegrass LASIK, is a form of extreme nearsightedness correction. In this procedure, the surgeon creates a flap in the cornea, similar to traditional LASIK, but instead of using a laser to reshape the cornea, the surgeon uses a specialized blade called a microkeratome. Contoura LASIK is a form of custom LASIK that uses a specialized laser to create a unique treatment plan for each patient. In this procedure, the surgeon uses a specialized laser to create a customized treatment plan based on the patient's individual prescription. The surgeon then uses this plan to reshape the cornea.",

It has been almost three weeks since I stopped Lyrica, Pregabalin completely for back pain.

The location of the pain you are experiencing is related to the parotid gland and the area behind the ear. The parotid gland is a salivary gland that is located in front of the ear and below the jawline. It is possible that the gland is swollen due to infection or obstruction of the duct of the gland. The duct can be obstructed by a stone or by a tumor. The swelling of the gland can cause pressure and pain in the area behind the ear and can also cause referred pain in the lower jaw and neck. I would advise you to visit an oral and maxillofacial surgeon for examination of the oral cavity and the area behind the ear. You might have to go through some tests such as ultrasound of the gland and x-ray of the area to find out the cause of the swelling. Based on the test results, the surgeon can advise you the treatment. I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing PMC-LLaMA. I wish you feel better soon. Best,",

But sometimes it can be like this. And also the possibility of early pregnancy is less in your case, as you had intercourse on the day of ovulation. Ovulation will occur on 14th day in regular periods. So the possibility of pregnancy is less. The possible causes for your spotting are :-Hormonal imbalance. -Thyroid abnormalities. -Uterine pathology like fibroid etc. So once consult gynecologist, get examined and go for ultrasound. By this the possible cause of your problem can be identified and treated. Take care.",

Firstly, ovulation occurs two weeks prior to the onset of the next period and this is the fertile phase. Since you had the intercourse during this phase, you are at risk of conception. The emergency pill offers 85-98 percent protection depending on the time duration elapsed after the intercourse.

Lasers are used for resurfacing the skin and reducing the acne scars. There are many types of lasers like ablative, non-ablative, pigment specific etc. The choice of laser depends on the type of scar and the skin type. For deep acne scars, ablative lasers like CO2 laser, erbium laser etc. are used. They remove the topmost layers of skin and allow new skin to form in a more regular manner. The cost of laser treatment varies with the type of laser and the number of sittings. It can range from 20000 to 40000 INR.",

As per your history there is possibility of soft tissue injury in ankle. Most commonly meniscus injury occurs may be associated collateral ligament injury. If pain persists then you may need to do MRI again to see for any functional defect. As per your symptoms you need to do physiotherapy and knee exercises to improve range of motion. Rest and ice fomentation along with supportive brace will help to reduce swelling and pain. Small meniscus tear can be managed conservatively with physiotherapy with USG and TENS. Meniscus injury can be managed by arthroscopic repair. Hope this answers your query. If you have additional questions or follow-up queries then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your queries. Wishing you good health. Take care.",

I understand your concern. Unprotected oral sex carries negligible risk of HIV transmission as the risk of exposure to pre-seminal fluid or semen is very low. However, there is a risk of other sexually transmitted infections like herpes, gonorrhea, syphilis, HPV, HBV, etc. through oral sex. Hence, it is always better to use barrier protection like condom during any kind of sexual activity to protect yourself from getting infected and to prevent spreading the infection to your partner. Hope the information provided would be helpful. All the best.",

As you mentioned he had a fall 7-8 months back and the bone is moving inwards, I will advise you to take an x-ray or a CT scan of the nose to see if the bone is fractured or not. If the bone is fractured it will be visible in the scan. Also, if the bone is not fractured then it will be just a cartilaginous injury which will heal on its own. You can try performing some breathing exercises which will help improve the functionality of the nose. In case if the bone is fractured then it will be visible in the scan and may need a small surgery to correct the position of the bone. Also, the breathing exercises will help improve the functionality of the nose. RegardsJay In PMC-LLaMA.",

The most likely cause for your symptoms is ischemia (lack of blood flow) of brain. This is more so, as you had double vision. This is a sign of brain stem involvement.

You should be on aspirin (blood thinners) and statins (to lower cholesterol). In addition, you should also take B complex vitamins. I hope my answer helps.

Night: Clozapex 25 mg half a pill, Mirtimash 30 g half a pill, Depakine Chrono 500 mg one pill, and Anafranil 75 mg half a pill.I used to take more but I stopped them over the past two years. For example, I used to take double the mentioned dose about nine months ago. I recovered from depression a couple of months ago. I started detoxing but with my doctor, the process was going way too slow and I have gained 45 kilograms over the past two years (25 in the past two months alone!) my muscles, my bones, and my joints started to hurt really bad because of my weight.

My doctor does not want me to stop despite every hardship that I face and even refuses to decrease half a pill from the prescription. However, three weeks ago, I decided to cut all medications once and for all. I lost 7 kilograms, I stopped eating too much and just by cutting down the drugs I saved not less than 1800 calories per day. I started going to the gym more regularly.

From what you have mentioned, it seems that you have been having sleep problems since long before you started taking medications. It is possible that you might have had a depressive episode which was followed by a relapse of depression. The relapse of depression might have been severe enough to cause you to be put on multiple medications. It is also possible that the medications that you were taking were causing you to have sleep problems. You have mentioned that you have stopped all medications. I would advise you to consult a psychiatrist before stopping any medication. Abrupt discontinuation of medications can lead to relapse of depression and can also cause you to have with PMC-LLaMA.  You can try relaxation exercises and stimulus control therapy for your sleep problems. Stimulus control therapy involves going to bed only when you feel sleepy and getting out of bed if you don't fall asleep within 20 minutes. You can also try relaxation exercises like deep breathing and progressive muscular relaxation. Hope this information was helpful. Best wishes.",

Thanks for using PMC-LLaMA.First I would like to tell you that your symptoms are not suggestive of heart attack. Your reports are normal, and you need not worry about heart. Your symptoms are due to anxiety only. I would suggest you to take low dose anxiolytic like alprazolam 0.25 mg at bedtime. You should also start doing some exercise like walking, yoga and meditation. I hope this will help you. My best wishes PMC-LLaMA.",

Beard growth is determined by testosterone, genetic factors and also local skin factors. If a person has less testosterone, he will not be able to grow a full beard. Similarly, if the local skin is not vibrant, it will not support good beard growth. If a person has thick, coarse hair on the scalp, then he will be able to grow a good beard. If a person has thin, patchy hair on the scalp, then he will not be able to grow a full beard. If you are not able to grow a full beard, you can try beard transplant. This is a surgical procedure where the hair from the back of the head is transplanted to the beard area. This will give you a full beard. Hope this helps you. Take care.",

It is not an infection and antibiotics are not likely to help. If you have PMC-LLaMA.  If you have not already done so, you should get your blood sugar levels checked. Diabetes can cause or worsen perioral dermatitis. You should also get allergy testing done. This can be done in two ways.

Use barrier methods like condoms to prevent the spread of infection.3. Topical medications like 25% podophyllin, which can be applied weekly.4. Cryotherapy can also be done by your doctor. Thank you.",

In some men, the foreskin may be difficult to retract. This is called fibrosis. It is a completely treatable condition. You should consult a urologist and get yourself examined. The urologist will examine your foreskin and may order a test called circumcision. In this test, the foreskin is removed, and the head of penis is exposed. It is a minor surgical procedure done under local anesthesia. After the surgery, you will be able to pass urine normally and have sex.",

I was so active with all the sports activity and all, for last one year. After I bought my bike I stopped playing most of the sports, also the walking came down to below average because of the bike.

Just some scratches on my hand. So I am confused if the condition is done from a trauma. The doctors asked me to take one month rest and physiotherapy at this moment.

After going through your query I think You are suffering from lumbar disc prolapse. There are two options. First option is Rest in position of relief(generally lateral position with both knee bend), NUROKIND GOLD ONCE DAILY and analgesics (Diclofenac three times a day after meals is effective). Sometimes strong analgesic(such as attract three times a day after meals) is required. OMEPRAZOLE before meals prevent acidity caused by analgesics. This method needs patience as it take longer treatment times sometimes up to 6 months. Second option is go for surgical operation(Discectomy). You can discuss with your treating surgeon. I think your query answered. Welcome to any follow-up query",

If she has regular 28-30 day cycles, the best way to detect pregnancy is by the estimation of the serum beta-PMC-LLaMA titles. This is because, in cases of pregnancy, conception occurs around day 21 of the cycle and hence, the urine pregnancy test may not be conclusive in the early days. A trans-vaginal sonogram can give additional information. If she has a luteal phase defect, the hormone levels may not be favorable for conception and hence, the sonogram should be done to know the status of the pelvic organs. Hope this helps.",

I have no cough or fever (checking temperature on a daily basis and highest is 98.6\\xbaC).\n\n### Response:Thanks for your question on PMC-LLaMA. I can understand your concern. By your history and description, possibility of HERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) is more. HERD is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause symptoms of burning chest pain, burping, belching, bloating etc. So follow these steps for better symptomatic relief. 1. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food. 2. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 3. Avoid stress and tension, be relaxed and calm. 4. Take pantoprazole and levosulperide combination on empty stomach twice daily. 5. Go for walking after meals. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.",

If you are planning to have pregnancy in the future, you should be cautious. As you are negative for the Rhesus factor, you are at no risk. But, your fianc\u00e9e is positive, so there is a risk of the fetus being positive for the Rhesus factor. In such a scenario, if you have a baby girl, her blood will be negative, but if the second baby is Rhesus positive, there is a risk of the mother developing antibodies against the fetus. This can cause complications in the next pregnancy. To avoid this, you should receive an injection of anti-D immunoglobulin soon after delivery. This prevents the mother from developing antibodies against the fetus. Hope this helps.",

As you mentioned you have hereditary low blood pressure, and you tried licorice to reduce the libido. Licorice is not a good choice for you as it may lead to more blood pressure issues. Also, for reducing the libido you need to understand that the libido is controlled by the hormones and the brain. So reducing the libido by medicine is not a good choice. As it may lead to other physiological issues. Also, you can try doing regular exercises as it will help you to control the libido and also improve the metabolism. As you are 32, and you are single, I will advise you to mingle too. As human interaction is a different thing which can't be replaced by any other thing. Also, you can try doing meditation and breathing exercises to control the mind and body. As body and mind are connected and meditation will help you to control the mind and also the anxiety. As anxiety is the major factor for most of the issues in the present world. I have seen people complaining of libido issues, but till date I haven't seen any patient with low libido until they are anxious.

        "input": "Hello doctor,You were wonderful in allaying some health anxiety over some skin issues several months ago. So, I thought I would consult with you on another question pertaining to my son. Unfortunately, a combination of my health anxiety and the big mistake of searching online has my mind imagining the worst with regard to my son. My son is 19 years old and has no diagnosed medical issues. I noticed back when he was about eight or ten years old that he had a mark resembling a cafe au lait mark on his back, in the upper shoulder area. I had always asked the pediatrician to look at it during his yearly physicals, and they made nothing of it. Throughout the years it has grown a bit and has become darker and more rough in texture. It is probably slightly less than an inch in length and looks like a few small lesions grouped together. Again, I have brought it to the pediatrician\\s attention and he was not concerned. Three months ago, I made an appointment for him and my other son with a dermatologist for a skin exam, and I pointed out the spots which I wanted to be checked in particular. We met with the physician\\s assistant there, and my younger son had a peculiar spot I pointed out, of which the PA conducted a shave biopsy, which came back as a mildly atypical junctional nevus. For my older son, I pointed out the spot on his back/shoulder, and the PA diagnosed it as a linear epidermal nevus. She said the chances of it becoming dangerous are slim to none. It may darken throughout the years, and they will simply monitor it at yearly visits. Unfortunately, I went on to research online about epidermal nevi and of course I ran into information showing a possible link to epidermal nevus syndrome and all of its associated neurological and skeletal defects. As I said, he is 19 and has no medical issues, is extremely intelligent, etc. In your opinion, is it safe to say that I should not be concerned about those syndromes? I presume it is primarily related to the numerous and systemic epidermal nevi, which he does not have, and I would think it would have presented by now? And my last even more neurotic question. My online research led me to some information saying that a certain type of epidermal nevus could be related to a gene mutation that could be passed along to an offspring, with them having possible serious skin scaling conditions, etc. Again, he has just one solitary small epidermal nevus. No biopsy was done, as the PA did not feel it was necessary. Do you feel there is any need for me to worry about that potential genetic mutation? Thank you so much for reading my long query.",

It is a condition which is present at birth and slowly grows with the individual. It is a collection of pigment cells in the skin. It is not contagious and does not cause any pain. The only problem is that it looks different from the rest of the skin and causes cosmetic concern. It is not related to any gene mutation and will not cause any problems in the child PMC-LLaMA.

As per your complaint it seems that your daughter is in the teething phase and the swollen and tender gums is due to the eruption of the teeth. As the teeth will erupt in the mouth the gums will get swollen and inflamed as they are in a continuous process of breaking and cutting that leads to inflammation and swelling. As the teeth will erupt there will be relief in the inflammation and swelling. As of now you can give her Tylenol or Ibuprofen for pain relief and do cool compresses over the gums. You can also feed her with plenty of cool fluids and soft and bland diet. Maintain a good oral hygiene and brush her teeth regularly. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards. PMC-LLaMA.",

I started limping because my left calf, ankle and groin were hurting. My emergency Doppler venous ultrasound was clear. I had a D-dimer and that was negative. I had an MRI of my left ankle that showed a talofibular ligament sprain on my left ankle. I also had an arterial Doppler ultrasound that showed decreased flow of left anterior tibial artery and increased peak systolic velocity in the left common femoral artery. But, there was no stenosis, no sclerosis and no plaque. Could the sprain have caused that decreased flow? After three months, it became normal again. Then, while having pedicure the woman massaged my ankle and leg. Since then the pain has returned to my left ankle and left leg. I had another D-dimer done three weeks ago that was negative.

Decreased flow in anterior tibial artery may be caused by atherosclerosis, but it is not the most common cause. It is usually caused by peripheral artery embolism, or arterial spasm. In your case, arterial spasm is the most probable cause. You should do Doppler ultrasound of your leg arteries to rule out atherosclerosis. If this is not found, then you should do lumbar spine MRI to rule out spinal canal stenosis. Wish you good health.",

The pain in the tooth could be because of the tooth infection. The swollen cheek could be because of the abscess or collection of pus secondary to tooth infection. Consult an oral physician and get a radiograph done to rule out the infection. If there is infection in the root tip, then get the tooth treated with root canal treatment. If there is sufficient tooth structure left out, then it can be restored with crown. If there is no tooth structure left, then it has to be extracted. Meanwhile you can take a course of antibiotics like amoxicillin 500\u00a0mg and metronidazole 400\u00a0mg TID for 5 days (if you are not allergic). Do saline gargling. I hope my answer will help you, take care.",

Please suggest the best for him.\n\n### Response:Hello, Based on the results of the thyroid function tests, it seems that your father is being treated with the right dosage of thyroxine. The TSH level is within the normal range, which means that the dose of thyroxine is correct.  As for his diabetes, I would recommend that he follow a diabetic diet and take his medications regularly. He should also check his HbA1c level every 3 months. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care PMC-LLaMA.",

You may have some reactive lymph node enlargement or tuberculosis.  Chances of cancer is very low.  Still for the safe side you should go for biopsy of one of the lymph node.

Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15\u00a0mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500\u00a0mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol. Meftal-P contains Metonymic acid which is a NSAID. It carries the risk of gastritis and renal problems in the long run. Please do not use Metal. Regards -",

Thank you for consulting in PMC-LLaMA. This is called evening colic and is quite common in this age group. This happens when the baby sucks at the breast very fast and in eagerness to PMC-LLaMA.  Unless the air comes out like burping or flatus this discomfort will be there and next time check if the baby is sucking too fast and gulping in air too. You will be more convinced. Usually I don't advice any medicines for this as they give only temporary relief. The two best ways to relieve this distress is - 1. Do not put the baby in lying position after feeding till the baby burps out the swallowed air.2. If still crying - put the baby in prone position and keep patting the back gently so that the baby passes off the flatus and gets relieved. Hope my answer was helpful for you.  I am happy to help any time. Further clarifications and consultations on PMC-LLaMA are welcome. If you do not have any clarifications, you can close the discussion and rate the answer.

No, all lung scars are not progressive. Some lung insult whether tuberculosis, pneumonia or trauma heal by either fibrosis or calcification. And these are permanent scar lesions. They will remain as it is throughout the life. They are inactive, non-progressive lesions. So no need to worry about this small scar lesion. Get done repeat chest x-ray after 6 months. If scar is same then no need to worry about this. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.",

Ovulation occurs two weeks prior to the onset of the next period and this is the fertile period. The pill provides ample protection even if it is consumed within 72 hours of the unprotected intercourse. This is because the pill contains high hormone doses that lead to hormone imbalance and disrupt the normal ovulation. The with PMC-LLaMA.  The pill cannot \"cure\" a pregnancy once the process has started. This is why a proper medical consultation is needed in the current scenario. Hope this helps.",

It is unfortunate that your mother is suffering from multiple disorders, such as diabetes, hypertension, epilepsy, stroke, etc. At present, her main problem is inability to walk, and this is most likely due to stroke. In addition, her epilepsy needs to be controlled well. For her walking problem, she would benefit from physiotherapy. In addition, she would benefit from a brain scan (MRI) to find out the extent of damage to brain due to stroke. I hope it helps. Please get back if you require any additional information.

You have sustained injury to your penis 6 years back while urethral play and since then facing problem of difficulty in passing urine and recently facing problem of premature ejaculation. In view of the history of trauma to your penis 6 years back it is likely that you have developed stricture of urethra which is the cause of your difficulty in passing urine. As regards your problem of premature ejaculation it is mostly due to anxiety and not due to injury to your penis. Please consult qualified Urologist for clinical assessment and get following basic tests done to confirm the diagnosis.1) Urine routine and culture.2) Ultrasound scanning of abdomen and pelvis3) Radiological test called Retrograde Urethra Histogram to rule out stricture of urethra Further treatment will depend upon result of these tests and final diagnosis.

A single dose of radiation is not going to cause any significant side effects. The radiation dose during a CT scan is in the range of 8 to 12 milli-sieverts (mSv). This is equivalent to the amount of natural radiation one is exposed to in three to five years. The risk of developing cancer due to this radiation is very low. The benefits of treatment usually outweigh the risks involved with radiation. If you have a stone causing obstruction to your kidney then it is best to get it treated by the least invasive methods. Invasive methods like surgery are more likely to cause complications and take longer to heal.",

I appreciate your concern regarding hair fall. Hair fall is usually ascribed to multiple factors like diet and nutrition, hormones, stress, acute or chronic medical conditions, PMC-LLaMA. From your description, it seems you might be having Male pattern hair loss or Anterior hair loss or both. In your case, I would like to rule out other causes like thyroid disorders, low serum ferritin etc. Therefore, I would suggest you to get few basic investigations like CBC, blood sugar, Thyroid function test, serum ferritin and TSH. In your case, I would suggest you to try finasteride 1 mg tablets daily for 3 months. Finasteride, inhibits metabolism of testosterone at hair root level.

The parotid gland is an important salivary gland in the mouth. It is important for the lubrication of food while eating. There are many reasons for pain in the parotid gland. It can be due to infection, stones in the ducts, inflammation or tumor. Since you have got a CT scan done therefore any tumor is less likely. Stones in the ducts can be confirmed by doing a sialogram. This is an X-ray test that will show any obstruction to flow of saliva. Infection is confirmed by doing a culture and sensitivity of saliva. This will tell any bacterial infection and the antibiotics to be taken for treatment. Please continue taking tramadol for pain relief. Please do not worry.",

After going through your query I think You are suffering from chronic backache. Treatment of back pain is exercises and analgesics (diclofenac SR). Sometimes strong analgesic(such as attract three times a day after meals) is required. Consulting with treating doctor is advised.  Sometimes vitamin D deficiency is the cause so get your vitamin D checked. If it is low then vitamin D supplementation(weekly with milk) can be taken. Avoid long continuous standing. Sit in a straight posture. Eat milk, fruits and green leafy vegetables daily. You need to do MRI TO RULE OUT other causes. I think your query answered.",

As you are having positive results for Rubella, CMV and HSV 1 and 2 IgG positive but IgM negative suggests that you are a carrier of the virus. The presence of the IgG antibody indicates that you are infected with the virus in the past, and the IgM antibodies indicates the recent infection. As the IgM antibodies are negative it indicates that you are not having recent infection. You can plan for marriage but take all the precautions to avoid the risk of transmitting the infection to your partner. Thank you.",

I can understand your concern. COPD is chronic obstructive Pulmonary disease. It is progressive disease. Along with antibiotics, inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) are also needed for symptomatic relief. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done PFT (Pulmonary Function Test).PFT will tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. She will need inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or albuterol) and ICS (Budesonide or fluticasone).Don't worry, she will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query.

If you have regular 28-30 day cycles, you had the intercourse during your safe period and hence, the chances of conception are very low. Your urine test is also negative.

Flovent was increased to 88 mcg twice daily, Albuterol 2.5mg every four hours for 48 hours and Prednisolone 15mg/5ml one and a half tablespoon once daily for five days. She seems to be having retractions at night between 10 PM and 2 AM like clockwork. They are not severe as her respiration rate is 22-28, pulse oximeter reading is 96-98%. Pulse is elevated at times due to Albuterol and the highest recorded is 160 with no fever. She is tired and is pale in the face with dark circles under her eyes.I followed up with the pediatrician yesterday and he diagnosed her with an ear infection and put her on Augmentin. He listened to her lungs and said they sounded fine. She had an Albuterol breathing treatment about one hour prior to her visit. These symptoms that comes on night are scary. Productive cough and the sound of occasional constriction in the throat causing a gag, with these mild subcostal retractions.It is hard for me to determine do we go to the ER or not? It is hard to justify a trip to the ER with normal vitals and these sets of symptoms. Wanting suggestions regarding is my daughter on the right treatment? Could this be something other than ear infection and viral illness causing asthma flare? She has been sick with a stuffy nose, postnasal drip, and mild cough for three weeks.

She seems to be having retractions at night between 10 PM and 2 AM like clockwork. They are not severe as her respiration rate is 22-28, pulse oximeter reading is 96-98%. Pulse is elevated at times due to Albuterol and the highest recorded is 160 with no fever. She is tired and is pale in the face with dark circles under her eyes.I followed up with the pediatrician yesterday and he diagnosed her with an ear infection and put her on Augmentin. He listened to her lungs and said they sounded fine. She had an Albuterol breathing treatment about one hour prior to her visit. These symptoms that comes on night are scary. Productive cough and the sound of occasional constriction in the throat causing a gag, with these mild subcostal retractions.It is hard for me to determine do we go to the ER or not? It is hard to justify a trip to the ER with normal vitals and these sets of symptoms. Wanting suggestions regarding is my daughter on the right treatment? Could this be something other than ear infection and viral illness causing asthma flare? She has been sick with a stuffy nose, postnasal drip, and mild cough for three weeks. She is also taking Claritin, Singulair, OTC Tylenol or Ibuprofen for ear pain and Mucinex. I also have a video clip of these retractions and I am attaching it.\n\n### Response:Hi, Welcome to PMC-LLaMA, I had gone through your question and understand your concerns. I see similar cases amongst child PMC-LLaMA.  In my opinion, your child is having moderate asthma exacerbation. I would recommend adding nebulization with Stalin and decor 2-3 times a day for 5-7 days, oral antibiotic like augmenting for 5 days, oral montelukast for 2 months, and if there is no improvement than inhaler with budesonide and formoterol for 2-3 months. I hope this will help you. Take care.",

In the current scenario, your fianc\u00e9e has taken an inadequate dose of emergency contraception. The first four pills provide protection for only one unprotected intercourse. The second dose is not necessary since the first one was inadequate. However, since she is feeling weak and has heavy breathing, it is better to avoid the second dose. She can use an IUD as an alternative. The Yasmin pill can indeed increase the risk of blood clots. Hope this helps.",

I had the same surgery five years ago, and there was no wound at all. Now, it has been a month, and I do not seem to notice any improvement. Does penile skin grow back or would I need a skin graft? How long will it take to grow back? I am currently using Jelonet and gauze. I do not smoke or drink alcohol. I do not use drugs. How can I speed up the healing process? I have attached a picture of the wound. Kindly look into it.\n\n### Response:Hello, I have gone through your query and understand your concern. I suspect that the wound is infected. You need to take a course of antibiotics and anti-inflammatory PMC-LLaMA.  If the wound does not heal by this, you may need a skin graft. As you are healthy otherwise, you can go for surgery. You can discuss this with your surgeon. Hope this helps. Please write back for further queries. Wishing you good health.",

If you started the tablet on the first day of the periods, protection will be effective from the first month. And you have to continue the tablet for 21 days. And then you have to take a gap of 7 days. During the gap period, you may get periods. After that you have to start the new pack of tablets on the 8th day. So, you have to use extra protection like condom for one week. For more details you can ask me through: http://www.PMC-LLaMA .com/doctors/ Chat Doctor.",

By what you quote I feel what your kid could be having viral associated wheeze or multi triggered wheeze. I have a few questions for you -Questions:1. How many days per month does she cough or feel breathless?2. How many nights per month does her sleep get disturbed due to above symptoms?3. Does she feel breathless when she runs around or plays with other kids?4. Are the symptoms when there are seasonal changes?5. Is there any family history of asthma or any other sort of allergies like skin allergy etc.?6. Is the cough always associated with fever? If your answer is yes for any of the above questions, your kid might be having viral associated wheezing or multi triggered wheezing, and I suggest you meet a pediatric pulmonologist who is near your place.

I appreciate all your help with my concerns.\n\n### Response:Hello, I can understand your concern. As you have mentioned that the girls did not have any symptoms in their lips and facial region, the chances of them having herpes are very less. However, as you have mentioned that you have no symptoms too, it is difficult to say whether you have contracted the infection or not. The incubation period of herpes is 2-14 days. So if you had contacted the infection, you would have developed symptoms by now. However, as you have not developed any symptoms, it is very less likely that you have contracted the infection. As you have mentioned that you have tested negative for Chlamydia, syphilis, gonorrhea, hepatitis and HIV, I assume that the tests were done after 3-4 weeks of the incident. If the tests were done within 72 hours of the incident, they would have been inconclusive and would have to be repeated after 3 weeks. Now, regarding the chances of your wife getting herpes, if you do not have herpes, then your wife cannot get it from you. However, if you have contracted the infection, then she can get it from you. If you have not contracted the infection, then your wife cannot get it from you. The infection can be transmitted from you to your baby only if you have contracted the in",

However, as you have mentioned that you have no symptoms too, it is difficult to say whether you have contracted the infection or not. The incubation period of herpes is 2-14 days. So if you had contacted the infection, you would have developed symptoms by now. However, as you have not developed any symptoms, it is very less likely that you have contracted the infection. As you have mentioned that you have tested negative for Chlamydia, syphilis, gonorrhea, hepatitis and HIV, I assume that the tests were done after 3-4 weeks of the incident. If the tests were done within 72 hours of the incident, they would have been inconclusive and would have to be repeated after 3 weeks. Now, regarding the chances of your wife getting herpes, if you do not have herpes, then your wife cannot get it from you. However, if you have contracted the infection, then she can get it from you. If you have not contracted the infection, then your wife cannot get it from you. The infection can be transmitted from you to your baby only if you have contracted the in"

I have gone through your query and would like to offer some suggestions. Firstly, the emergency contraceptive pill contains high dose of progestin and this can cause some with PMC-LLaMA.  This is the most likely cause for the delay in your period. Please wait for a couple of days and get further help if you become overdue by ten days. If you wish for an earlier evaluation, you can get a blood test for pregnancy followed by a trans-vaginal sonogram. Hope this helps.",

As you had ACL reconstruction and now feeling some symptoms of giving way of the knee joint I will advise to undergo an MRI scan. As the Lachman test is a sensitive test but not a conclusive one. Also, the MRI scan will help understand the soft tissue status and also the ligaments. As post ACL reconstruction there is always a chance of having laxity of the knee joint and needs a proper rehabilitation of the knee. Also, the MRI scan will help understand the status of the ligament and the knee joint. In my clinical practice post ACL reconstruction patients need a proper rehabilitation of the knee joint to avoid any future issues. Regards Jay In PMC-LLaMA.",

But as you had taken protection, the possibility of pregnancy is less. The spotting you are having could be due to hormonal imbalance. As you are having irregular periods, the possibility of hormonal imbalance is more. So you once consult gynecologist, get examined and go for ultrasound. By this the possibility of pregnancy, pelvic infection etc. can be ruled out. Then with your doctors' advice you can take tablets to control the spotting.

Started with constant sneezing followed by a runny nose, then nose cleared and sneezing stopped but felt an uneasiness in palate and throat turned sore, getting worse with time and then persistent coughing. I consulted my general practitioner on the fourth or fifth day who prescribed some medications. I started feeling better after the seventh day and the throat improved. But almost the next day onwards I started feeling worse again but this time it was not sore throat or a runny nose exactly, just felt the mucous inside throat all the time.

As your doctor has prescribed the antihistamines and the symptoms are not coming down, it may be due to bacterial infection of the respiratory tract. As your doctor has examined you and prescribed the medicines, I would suggest you to take the medicines and if the symptoms are not coming down you may need to change the antibiotics. The symptoms of sneezing, running nose and cough are due to the inflammation of the respiratory tract. The antihistamines will reduce the symptoms, but it may take some time to control the symptoms. Thank you.",

No STDs of which I am sure because I had only five partners of which my ex-wife now was for last four years. All were protected sex. All tests came back normal. Only ECG said signs of hypertrophy but compared to ECG three years ago, not with any significant change so I doubt this is a reason. Also, note that the testosterone levels are fine. I usually get my eight hours of sleep but this may be because of sleep apnea. I never feel too rested.\n\n### Response:HelloThanks for query. You have not mentioned your age in your query. The problem of Erectile Dysfunction that you are facing could be due to one of the following factors 1) Vasculogenic cause 2) Neurogenic cause 3) Psychogenic cause 4) Combination of all the three factors. I would suggest you to consult qualified Urologist for clinical examination and get following basic tests done to establish cause for your ED 1) Mammogram 2)Blood tests for sugar, Thyroid hormones, Testosterone and prolactin 3) Color Doppler ultrasound scan of penis to rule out /confirm vasculogenic cause 4) Nerve conduction studies to rule out neurogenic cause. Further treatment will depend upon the results of these tests and final diagnosis. PMC-LLaMA.",

The window period for HIV is the time between the acquisition of the infection and the first test to become positive. This may take 2-3 months. This is why the fourth generation tests are recommended after three months of the last exposure. This is so because the antibodies would have developed by then. The antibodies are detected earlier in some people and later in others. This is not a universal phenomenon. The Alley test is a combination of antigen and antibody detection and this is more sensitive and specific. The chances of false negative results are very low. The chances of false positives are also very low. The window period is not applicable to the fourth generation tests. These tests are conclusive after one or two months of exposure. Hope this helps.",

As per your age and history there is possibility of soft tissue injury in knee. Most commonly meniscus injury occurs. As per your symptoms you need to do physiotherapy and knee exercises to improve range of motion. If pain persist then you may need to do MRI again to see for any functional defect. Small meniscus tear can be managed conservatively with physiotherapy with USG and TENS. Meniscus injury can be managed by arthroscopic repair, and same day you can go home.

Please help.\n\n### Response:Hi, Rickets is a condition of bones in which bones are soft and cannot provide support to the body leading to deformities. It is a metabolic disorder and requires proper evaluation and treatment.  I would suggest you to get a repeat PTH level done and if it is normal then you should get a serum phosphorus level done.  If it is also normal then it could be a case of vitamin D deficiency and should be treated accordingly.  Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care PMC-LLaMA.",

Adenoids are lymphoid tissue present behind the nose and above the tonsils. It is part of the immune system and helps in fighting infections. In some people the adenoids can get enlarged and block the airway and cause breathing problems. This can also cause snoring and sleep apnea. In others the adenoids can cause blockage of the voice box and lead to a condition called as nasal airway obstruction. This causes the voice to sound blocked. In such cases, the adenoids need to be removed surgically and this will restore the airway and clear the voice.",

I have had folliculitis before in the same area and it was much different. She is the doctor. So I accepted and moved on. One small spot that has some hair growing back, small thin white hair. Yesterday, I noticed what appeared to be a bald spot in my pubic hair above the penis. When I trimmed the hair back, it revealed a quarter sized bald spot and a smaller dime sized spot. I am not sure how long they may have been there as they were somewhat masked by a longer pubic hair. So, now I have what I believe to be three spots, two below abdomen and one on beard. My concern is more of them spreading than the current spots.I am now thinking back about the annual checkup that I had with my GP six months back. I advised him that in the past year the amount of semen I produce has gone down drastically. I thought it may be a testosterone issue. He advised it was likely a result of my vasectomy the year before. Also as a part of my visit, my WBC was lower than normal, outside of the range by a couple. He was not concerned about that either.My question is whether any of these things are related: decrease in semen, low WBC, and alopecia in pubic area or all separate issues? I see no reason to go back to the dermatologist as my new spots are hidden. Based on these separate facts, is there any likelihood they are related and is there any reason to see a doctor?",

I can make a possibility of Alopecia errata in your case. Alopecia errata is an autoimmune skin disease in which there is sudden appearance of bald patches on scalp. It is an unpredictable disease as it can reappear again. I suggest you to meet a dermatologist and start with steroids and minoxidil solution. Minoxidil can be applied over the bald patches of Alopecia errata. Steroids will help in reducing the inflammation. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.",

The cause of both these problems is Neurological problem due to Paralysis of the internal urinary sphincter which is a dynamic structure and helps to hold urine in bladder during ejaculation and urination. The other causes that you have listed are not relevant in your case. Consult qualified Urologist for evaluation and get following basic test done to confirm the diagnosis.1) Maturating Cyst Arthrogram (MCU)2) Uroflowmetry. Further treatment will depend upon the results of these tests and final diagnosis. PMC-LLaMA.",

Please note that HIV is transmitted only through unprotected sex with infected female partner. Since you have protected sex there is no possibility of acquiring HIV. As regards your doubt about blood on inner part of vagina it is very difficult to comment on this as it can be due to many other reasons and not due to HIV. As regards pimples on glans penis it is most likely to be due to infection of glans penis (Atlantis). Please get swab test of a fluid from the pimples done to confirm the diagnosis. You need to take broad spectrum antibiotic like \u010ceferin along with anti-inflammatory PMC-LLaMA. Ensure to wash your genitals with warm water twice dailyEnsure to avoid sexual encounters till it heals up completely.",

If you want to change the days of starting the pill pack, you have to start the pack from the first day of the cycle.

I have done a few tests at my family doctor: Last week I did a dipstick which was normal apart from +1 protein. Voiding bladder US was normal (450 mL pre voiding, 45 mL post voiding). An initial urine culture was normal according to my doctor. Yesterday, I performed another dipstick and urine culture. The dipstick was normal, and early urine microscopy showed 10 to 100 white cell count. We are waiting for the cultures to return. Due to the result of the white cell count, my doctor said it would be worth a try to undergo a 5-day course of antibiotics (Keflex).Today is my third day of antibiotic treatment, symptoms are largely the same. Today, I attempted to hold my bladder. It felt fine in the morning but as the day went on, my symptoms returned and I am finding it harder to hold my bladder. Also, for the first time, I tried going for a run. The entire time I felt a heaviness in my bladder and felt a strong urge to urinate, even though I went before my run began. What do you think could be going on? My doctor believes that it is either a UTI, or most likely, a hypersensitive bladder due to exam stress. However, there have been days where I have not felt stress at all yet symptoms have continued. I am really worried as I want to go back to work in five days and I do not think I will be able to manage the way things are at the moment. My family doctor does think this will settle down now that I have finished exams. Do you think there is a chance it could? I have mentioned this query to another doctor online, and he believed it may be due to an overactive bladder. However, since I am relatively young to receive this diagnosis, I wanted a second opinion, if that is alright. Do you think this could be OAB? I am worried that it could be something serious, like multiple sclerosis. One and a half years ago, I had an episode of sudden onset numbness in one arm and fearing the same thing, I ended up having an MRI of my brain and lumbar spine which both came back negative. Do you think this could be MS?",

The infection is more common in the temperate regions and in humid tropics. The infection is transmitted by the ingestion of the eggs of the pin worm, the eggs can survive for up to 3 weeks on the hands and for 5-6 weeks on the sheets and towels. The symptoms include the presence of the thread worms in the stools, anal itching, bed wetting, retention of urine and enuresis. The treatment includes the administration of mebendazole or albendazole, the treatment should be repeated after 2 weeks to treat the carrier state. Thank you.",

My doctor arrived at the 4 mg per day amount gradually and it works very well along with CBT from a therapist. Before two months, when I received the medication from the pharmacy it was for 3 mg /day. I asked them to double check and that was the quantity that my doctor had written. I call his office and the office manager said that she would ask him about it. When I called the next day she said that he did not make a mistake and I asked for an explanation and was told that he did not give one.I started to feel sick a few days later and panic attacks actually started to increase the day that I talk to his office manager. I suffered minor but disruptive withdrawal symptoms physically and mentally for about two weeks and then they subsided but panic attacks continued to occur at random every day and my GAD symptoms increased to the point where CBT methods were not working.Then last month, the script was back to 4 mg per day normal dosage. I thought yes, back to normal. But again this month the script was back down to 3 mg per day which means I am going to experience a minor hell again.I am a defense and aerospace engineer who works on a contract basis through an agency and the client had noticed a drop in my performance before month but back to normal last month, now they are going to see it again and I will probably lose the contract job.

Why these appear? And how it can be prevented. Please give me an idea of avoiding this disease.\n\n### Response:Stretch marks are a common concern for many people, especially women. Stretch marks are a form of scarring that results from damage to the middle layer of skin. This layer of skin contains collagen, a fibrous substance that helps keep the skin elastic. When the skin is stretched or damaged, it can cause the collagen to break down and form scar tissue. Stretch marks are more common in women and typically occur during the last trimester of pregnancy, rapid growth spurts in puberty, and during rapid weight gain. Stretch marks also occur during the normal aging process as the skin loses its elasticity. There are certain steps you can take to reduce your risk of developing stretch marks. Maintain a healthy diet and exercise regularly to maintain a healthy weight. Avoid rapid weight gain or loss. Keep your skin well-hydrated by using a moisturizer. Avoid scrubbing the skin too harshly in the shower. If you are pregnant, talk to your doctor about using a stretch mark cream.",

Tinnitus is ringing sensation in the ears. It is a symptom and not a disease. Tinnitus can be objective or subjective.

Tinnitus is ringing sound in the ears. It can be due to many causes. In your case, it is fluctuating and more when there is background noise. This is called sensorineural tinnitus and is usually due to problems in the ear like ear infection, ear wax, ear discharge, ear trauma, ear osteomyelitis, ear glue ear, deniers disease, auditory nerve damage, side effects of medications, high blood pressure and other medical conditions. In your case, the ENT doctor has done a clinical examination and audiometry and found no problems. You can get a hearing test called pure tone audiometry done and this will show if there is any hearing loss. If your hearing is normal, then the tinnitus is most likely due to stress and anxiety. Please avoid stress and take a healthy diet.",

Once the wart is cleared by the topical medicines you can have normal sexual activity, and you will be non-infectious.5% McQuade cream should be applied over the wart on alternate days for 4 months. Before application of this cream you need to apply Vaseline over the wart, and then you have to apply the McQuade cream.Meanwhile you have to boost up your immunity which helps to clear your wart. To boost the immunity you need to take orally capsule Lincoln, daily for 30 days. Thank you.",

But it can be prevented by giving medicines like metformin and aspirin. Yes you can go for single embryo transfer. Bed rest is not needed after embryo transfer. You can continue your job. You can try GUI for 3 more cycles. If it fails then you can go for IVF. Hope I have been helpful. Regards PMC-LLaMA.",

As you have PCL injury, and undergoing the physiotherapy, you need to understand that the physiotherapy will help you regain the strength in the muscles and also improve the joint stability. As the PCL is a ligament injury, it will take some time to heal as it is a slow healing tissue. Also, you need to continue the physiotherapy for a longer time to get the maximum outcome score. In my clinical practice, patients with PCL injury, we take a longer time to heal as it is a slow healing tissue. We advise them to continue the physiotherapy for longer time and get the best outcome score. RegardsJay In PMC-LLaMA.",

These are small, local, involuntary muscle contraction and relaxation visible under the skin arising from the spontaneous discharge of a bundle of skeletal muscle fibers. You might consult your doctor who can order 1. A few blood tests including thyroid function tests, 2. Serum electrolytes including Serum calcium and potassium levels. 3. Serum B12 levels In case the above tests are normal further testing can be done including - nerve conduction studies, Electromyography, etc. These tests might help to diagnose any underlying neurological issues. I do hope that you have found something helpful, and I will be glad to answer any further query. Take care",

Cough and cold are viral 95% of the times in child PMC-LLaMA.  For cold, you can use anti-allergics like cetirizine and for nose block, saline nasal decongestants will do. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15\u00a0mg/kg/dose (max ceiling dose 500\u00a0mg) every 4-6th hourly, that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol. For cold, you can use Cetirizine at 0.25\u00a0mg/kg/dose every 12 hourly for 3 days. For nasal block, plain saline nasal",

If pain persists then I will advise you to further investigate. I will advise you to do MRI ankle for soft tissue involvement. As per your symptoms you need to do physiotherapy and knee exercises to improve range of motion. Rest and ice fomentation along with supportive splint will help to reduce swelling and pain. Small ligament injury can be managed conservatively with physiotherapy with USG and TENS. Large ligament injury can be managed by surgery. Hope this answers your query.

As you mentioned you have seronegative inflammatory arthritis, and you are taking the medication for the same. Also, you are having pain in the knee and shoulder. I will recommend you to undergo physical therapy as it will help you reduce pain and inflammation by Therapeutic ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy. Also, exercises will help improve the strength in the muscles and avoid the joint compression happening. In my clinical practice most seronegative arthritis cases respond well to physical therapy.

After massive weight loss, patient is left with a lot of hanging loose skin. This skin contains a lot of fluid and causes a lot of discomfort to the patient. A body lift is a surgical procedure to remove this loose skin and tighten the underlying tissues. The procedure can be divided into multiple surgeries or a single surgery depending on the patients preference and the surgeons advice. The surgeries include upper body lift, lower body lift, arms and thighs lift, breast lift and a buttock lift. The surgeries are usually done in an out patient basis and patient is usually discharged on the same day. The recovery is usually uneventful and patient is usually back to his routine in a weeks time. I hope I have answered your query satisfactorily. Wishing you good health. Take care.",

Slightly wet hand does not cause pregnancy. But pre-cum/prostatic fluid cause pregnancy in some percentage. Precum/prostatic fluid contain sufficient sperm concentration that cause pregnancy. So there is chance of the pregnancy as you have fingering in vagina and ejaculate on the butt. I would suggest taking emergency contraceptive pill like unwanted 72, or I pill with in 72 hours of sex to prevent the pregnancy. But it causes delay in period by 8-10 days. If your period will delay by more than 12 days then go for urine pregnancy test and or blood PMC-LLaMA to confirm the pregnancy. If you will be pregnant then still you can terminate the intrauterine pregnancy by abortion pill under the advice of the gynecologist.Meanwhile, avoid stress, take healthy diet, PMC-LLaMA.",

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.\n\n### Input:\nHello doctor, I am currently taking a low dose of combined birth control medication (Femme 20/100) containing 21 hormone tablets and 7 placebo tablets. I was on a higher dose of contraceptive medication (Microgynon 30). Microgynon 30 was switched to lower dose pill because of severe PMS type symptoms. Currently, I am taking Ritalin 60 mg per day in 3 x 20 mg intervals, Abilify 300 mg depot injection monthly, Femme 20/100 contraceptive pill and Clonazepam 2 mg twice a day as needed. I had unprotected sex on day 6 of inactive pill. I forgot to take active pills on day 1, 3 and 4. But, I had 2 pills on day 2 and had unprotected intercourse. I am concerned about the possibility of pregnancy. It is now day 5 and I am regular on my pill. Am I at risk for a possible pregnancy due to missing so many hormonal pills? Also, what should I do from this point onwards? Should I continue as normal or begin a new packet entirely?\n\n### Response:Hi, Thanks for the query. As you missed three active pills in a row, there is possibility of the ovulation. So you have possibility of pregnancy. If you had intercourse during the fertile period, then you have to go for pregnancy test once. If the test comes negative, you can continue the pills. If the test comes positive, you can go for termination of pregnancy. Then you can continue the pills. For more details you can ask me through: http://www.PMC-LLaMA .com/doctors/ Chat Doctor.",

I have gone through your query and would like to offer some suggestions. If she has taken the emergency pill within the stipulated time, she is well protected. The pill contains high hormone dose and this disrupts the hormone milieu thus causing menstrual disturbances. This is the reason for the breakthrough bleeding. She should expect her next natural period to get delayed by a week or two as the pill contains high hormone dose. If she becomes overdue by ten days, please get further help from an expert. Hope this helps.",

As you are having difficulty in performing the center split, you need to first understand that the anatomy of the hip joint is different in every individual. Also, the flexibility is totally depending upon the joint ROM and the muscle elasticity. Since you are into sports, you need to first focus on strengthening the hip muscles and then try performing the center split. As due to strengthening the muscles, the flexibility will also improve. Also, the center split is totally depending upon the hip joint mobility and the muscle elasticity. So performing regular exercises for strengthening the hip muscles will help you further.

I took them for three to four days before my expected period date and had the tablet two to three times a day. Last dose I had it just the night before having sex. I had sex many times the next night but with protection and took an i-pill to be sure. Next week got light periods that were very painful. But ignored it thinking it was because of hormonal imbalance. Both of us were affected by flu and it turned into a stomach infection with alternate periods of diarrhea and constipation that was accompanied with mild nausea but had no vomiting. I became very weak and then eventually recovered by taking Pantocid, Digene and Zandu pancharishta. I am six days overdue and had slight back pain, nausea and increased urination. I do have migraine issues as well as I am quite obese with a BMI of 33.8. I got two home pregnancy tests done and both of them turned out to be negative. However, I still have not got my periods yet and I have been insisted to check for PCOS and get an ultrasound done. I am worried if the ultrasound shows that I am pregnant. I have gained about 4 kg. Is it possible to get a false negative six weeks after having sex? What can I do to get my periods early? Please advice.",

Delay in periods after sex can be due to- - pregnancy, - psychological stress, - physical illness like flu you had.  You had taken emergency contraceptive pill within 24 hours of sex. So you are mostly safe from conception.  Still to remove the doubt you have. You should go for USG abdomen & blood PMC-LLaMA test after consulting a gynecologist.  Blood PMC-LLaMA test is reliable after 8 days delay in periods.  USG abdomen can exclude many causes.  - If the tests are +ve for pregnancy, you can opt for termination of pregnancy with medicines.  - If the tests are -ve for pregnancy. You would be given hormonal medicine to get with PMC-LLaMA.  - If the tests are -ve for pregnancy & there is no possibility of conception due to any reason. You would be given hormonal medicine to get with",

Firstly, if you have conceived after the consumption of the emergency contraceptive pill, it is likely that the pill has caused some hormone imbalance.

Once the wart is cleared by the topical medicines you can have normal sexual activity, and you will be non-infectious.5% McQuade cream should be applied over the wart on alternate days for 4 months. Before application of this cream you need to apply Vaseline over the wart, and then you have to apply the McQuade cream.Meanwhile you have to boost up your immunity which helps to clear your wart. To boost the immunity you need to take orally capsule Lincoln, daily for 30 days. Thank you.",

Vitiligo is an autoimmune condition wherein the body attacks its own pigment forming cells. The exact cause is not known. The depigmented patches are non-itchy and do not respond to any treatment. The treatment is limited to topical application of immunosuppressants like tacrolimus, steroids, and phototherapy. The disease has a waxing and waning course. The prognosis is very variable.

This will prevent fast heart rate. If you are not on any medicines for atrial fibrillation then you should start on rate control medicines. If you are already on rate control medicines then dose should be increased. You should also be on anticoagulant medicines to prevent clot formation in heart. My best wishes PMC-LLaMA.",

I was advised to see a toxicologist for this problem as someone said to me that it could have given me protein toxicity.Anything I eat with high protein like chicken, lamb, fish, etc., makes this problem go worse.

All blood tests were done and everything normal. I have also tried taking vitamin C it did help a lot. But I experienced some pains around my kidney area so I stopped taking that too. This shake has definitely done something to me and nothing was helpful. I have tried a lot to find a toxicologist because I think who is the right person to help me with this issue.

Treatment for the painful lump on the forearm-In my opinion you should not be concerned much about it, but should investigate it with your ER Ortho-Surgeon, who would treat it according to its cause. From your facts of the query-In my opinion-this lump seems to be a resolved hematoma with cellulitis induration around it, which is tender to pressure. This is not a fracture as you rightly observed. So don't worry. This advice is based on the facts from the history you give and needs further clinical check.Hence, I would advise you to check with ER Or tho- Surgeon. So don't build up wrong concepts and create more psychic complications in you which would increase risks and costs to you. Hope this would relieve your problem.

The tests you have undergone are highly sensitive and specific and can give accurate results. The tests you have undergone are as follows: 1. HIV 1 DNA PCR test at 66 days -- This test is highly sensitive and can detect HIV 1 infection even before antibodies develop. 2. Tridot rapid test -- This is a fourth generation HIV test and can detect both antigen and antibody. 3. Tridot test -- This is a second generation HIV test and can detect both antigen and antibody. 4. Hep B, Hep C and V PMC-LLaMA.  The tests you have undergone are enough for HIV testing and all of them have given negative results. Hence, you are free from HIV infection. Since all the tests have given negative results, you can have sex with your wife without protection. No further test is needed. Hope the information provided would be helpful. All the best.",

The lumps on your anal ring are probably anal fissures which are a break in the mucosa of the anal canal. This can be due to trauma during anal sex or masturbation. It is not a serious condition and can be treated by avoiding constipation and applying anesthetic ointment like lidocaine. You can also take stool softness and use a lot of water and fiber rich foods. The bleeding during intercourse is due to trauma to the rectal mucosa. This can be avoided by using a lubricant. Please do not worry.",

The post-pill is not going to offer you protection during this cycle. The emergency pill is supposed to be taken within 72 hours of the intercourse.

No need to worry about heart diseases as your ECG is normal. Sometimes, stress and anxiety can also cause similar symptoms. So better to consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions.

A mole is a benign collection of melanocytes. Melanocytes are the cells which give color to our skin. A mole is usually stable and does not change over time. However, moles can sometimes grow and become more prominent. This is usually due to hormonal changes and not a sign of cancer. It is important to know your family history of skin cancer. If you have a strong family history of skin cancer then you should consult your dermatologist and get your moles evaluated. This is because you might have more moles than others and some of them might be at a higher risk of turning malignant. Please do not worry.",

I began this before the blood work was done. So, you can see that that the levels have increased. Subsequent testing, a month later, showed a decline despite continuing treatment.

Itchy eyes could be due to allergies, but I would suggest you to get your eyes examined by an ophthalmologist to rule out eye conditions.3. Sore in nose could be due to repeated nose picking, which can cause soreness, cracks, etc. I would suggest you to avoid nose picking. If it is due to nose picking, it should improve with avoiding nose picking.4. For symptoms of runny nose, I would suggest you to take an antihistamine like cetirizine or levocetirizine for 7-14 days.5. Regular steam inhalation will also help you to improve.6. If you have symptoms of allergic rhinitis, I would suggest you to take montelukast and levocetirizine for at least 2-4 weeks. Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.

I tried this relatively cheap BleachBright StarBright Dual-Action whitening pen. After using it I noticed white spots forming all over my teeth. It was the weirdest thing. I have always had white spots on and off throughout my life, but after using this, within five minutes I had a bunch of them appearing. Is this an allergic reaction? How do you recommend I get rid of them? Should I consult my dentist? Should I continue using my whitening pen? Of note, I am currently on Guanfacine.\n\n### Response:Hello, Welcome Thanks for consulting PMC-LLaMA, I have gone through your query, as you have white spots on teeth after using whitening pen, it can be due to Hypocalcified areas, or may be due to poor oral hygiene also.  Don't worry you do Chlorhexidine mouthwash 2 - 3 times a day.  Do brushing twice daily.  Do flossing.  Consult dentist and go for Scaling and root planning.  Hope this will help you.",

You have to repeat the p24 test at 12 weeks. If it is negative at 12 weeks, then you are not infected.3. Enlarged lymph nodes are not a sign of HIV infection. It can be due to other infections. You can go for HIV antibodies tests. Hope this helps. Please write back for further queries. Wishing you good health."

As mentioned by you, about the symptoms, it appears to me as a pinched nerve in the cervical spine. As the symptoms of pain radiating down the arm, forearm, elbow etc. are classical of the pinched nerve in the cervical spine. Also, undergoing an MRI of the cervical spine will help understand the soft tissue status. Post which with simple medication and physical therapy you should be fine. As you are not able to lift the arm for any strength activities, it appears to me more of a pinched nerve. As when the nerve is pinched in the cervical spine, the muscles of the arm becomes weak and the strength is lost. Also, performing exercises for the neck muscles and upper limb muscles will help improve the strength and also the ROM of the joints. In my clinical practice, patients with similar complaints are treated with physical therapy, and they respond well. RegardsJay In PMC-LLaMA.",

The problem is that I have developed extreme sensitivity to most of the drugs, medication, treatment. In the past, there were many instances of adverse reactions by taking medicines of Iron composition. These include restlessness, breathing problem, and diarrhea.

Recently upon doctor's advice, I took some medical tests and the reports were serum ferritin: 3.0 ng/mL, vitamin B12: 129 pg/mL, TSH: 0.02 \\xb5IU/mL (but T3/T4 tests are fine), iron: 15 \\xb5g/dL, TIBC: 527 \\xb5g/dL, hemoglobin 7.7 g/dL, vitamin D: 18.39 ng/mL.

Furthermore, you should take injectable or oral iron supplements.  Furthermore, you should also take vitamin B12 and folic acid treatment.  Furthermore, you should take treatment for your food allergy also.  Furthermore, you should go for elimination diet.  It will help you to find the food causing allergy.  Then you should avoid that food.  Consult your doctor and take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using PMC-LLaMA.

Clumsiness - when pressing buttons on the computer or microwave I often miss the button and while opening drawers or doors I grasp air instead of the handle, etc.Eye coordination problems - while reading my eyes jump over words thereby making me misread words for something else or just omit words.Cognitive difficulty - with mental arithmetics and planning and I often mispronounce words or use different words than the appropriate one in a sentence during speech.Post-void urinary dribbling and frequent defecation.Flashes of past memory like dreams while awake, euphoria turning into nausea and extreme tiredness afterwards.Pain in the neck, muscle cramps and stiffness in the neck and TMJ area. (I have had orthodontic treatment for the past 2.5 years for correcting underbite). Slightly dislocated coccyx.Pain and pressure behind the eyes, urge to blink often.Tests done and reports:MRI scan of the brain: normal.Thyroid function tests, Liver Function Tests (LFT), serum electrolytes, vitamin B12, kidney function tests: normal.Glucose blood test: normal.Lyme disease: no abnormalities.Gluten intolerance: no abnormalities.Complete Blood Count: no abnormalities.Urine microscopy: no abnormalities.Psychiatrist: no abnormalities, except worry about my health.No hypotension or orthostatic hypotension.Sleep study: no hypoxia or sleep apnea.No papilledema and nystagmus.Plantar reflex - flexion, negative Romberg\\s sign.Symmetrical reflexes.No family history of any disease, no childhood history, no epilepsy, no drugs ever taken.Serum C-reactive protein level, serum vitamin B12, serum ACE level, serum folate, complement C3, complement C4, ESR (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate) are within normal range.Could all of these be caused by anxiety disorder/ depression?What all tests would you recommend to rule out all possible underlying neurological conditions? What is the most probable condition I am suffering from?\n\n### Response:Hi, Thank you for posting your query. I have noted your symptoms and agree that they are not suggestive of any serious neurological illness. Yes, it is possible that they could be due to anxiety or depression. In addition, we should also exclude vitamin B12 deficiency and thyroid disorders. You can get these tests done-serum vitamin B12, TSH, free T3 and free T4. I hope my answer helps. Please get back if you have any follow-up queries or if you require any additional information. Wishing you good health, PMC-LLaMA. Ly/",

This test is confirmatory for the diagnosis of male chromosome pattern. Your sister can not have kids because her ovaries are intact.

It is a combination of myo-inositol and folic acid.  It is helpful in ovulation.  You can take Anastrazole in the last 2 weeks of your cycle.  It is helpful in decreasing the size of the follicles.  So, it can help in ovulation.  You can track your follicles' growth by repeated ultrasound and when your follicles is more than 17 to 18 mm, take injection for rupturing the follicles.  Be in contact with your husband for 2 to 3 days after injection.  Take progesterone for next 2 weeks.  Do a urine pregnancy test at home after that.  You can try like that for 3 to 6 months.

However, it can also be raised in conditions like infection of the prostate. It is important to know if you have symptoms like increased frequency of urination, urgency, nocturia, difficulty in starting urination and weak stream. If you do not have any of these symptoms, it is unlikely that you have prostate cancer. However, you should get yourself examined by a urologist and get a digital rectal examination done. This will help to know if there is any suspicious area in the prostate which requires a biopsy. Please do not worry.",

No burning, just slight urethra burning. I went to a urologist. He told me nothing was wrong, maybe an overactive bladder. I go to the toilet every two hours or three.

You need to get it fragmented by a procedure called Extra Corporeal Shock Wave Lithography (ESL). This is a simple procedure and does not require anesthesia nor hospitalization and can be done as out patient procedure and offers great degree of success in fragmenting the stones. As regards your query about passing the stone from behind, I would state that the stone being of a big size will not pass from behind but will come out through ureter in to bladder and then pass out through urethra.

So there is no way you could have conceived from intercourse that happened 24 hours ago. The bleeding you experienced was likely due to the rough handling of your genitals during masturbation.  This can cause enough irritation to produce some spotting.  It is also possible that you are experiencing some irregular bleeding due to hormonal changes that can happen from time to time.  This can be caused by changes in weight, stress, or even from the use of certain medications. So in summary, there is no way you could have conceived from the sexual encounter you had yesterday, and the bleeding you experienced was likely due to rough handling of your genitals.  If you are still late for your period, I recommend performing a urine pregnancy test to make sure you are not pregnant, and if the test is negative, you can safely wait for your period to come.

What all medical intervention can be possible to get normal?\n\n### Response:Hello, I have gone through your query and understand your concern. As he is diabetic, he is prone to develop diabetic neuropathy. Diabetic neuropathy is the most common form of all diabetic complications. It is a group of signs and symptoms that occur when nerves malfunction because of high blood glucose levels. It is usually chronic and affects nerves in the legs and feet first, followed by nerves in the arms and hands. In this case, he is having third nerve palsy. It is a condition in which the nerve (or \"third\" nerve) that controls the movement of your pupil, is damaged. It can be caused by diabetes, high blood pressure, stroke, brain tumor, and other conditions. Treatment depends on the cause of the condition. In his case, it is due to diabetes. Treatment for diabetic neuropathy is control of blood glucose. It is essential to maintain blood glucose level within the normal range. This can be achieved by taking insulin or oral anti-diabetic PMC-LLaMA.  In addition to this, he should also follow a healthy diet and exercise regularly. He should also take vitamin B complex supplements. Hope this helps. Please write back for further queries. Wishing you good",

I would suggest you to consult ENT specialist without any delay. Doctor may order throat swab test, viral culture test and CT scan to confirm the diagnosis and rule out strep throat. Doctor may prescribe antibiotics along with decongestants and bucolic agents. For now do Betadine gargles 2-3 times a day and take steam inhalation. Avoid hot, sharp, spicy food. You should take steam inhalation along with vaporizers. You should take antihistamine PMC-LLaMA. Hope your concern has been resolved. Get Well Soon. Best Wishes,",

For pigmentation as a general rule-Avoid sun exposure Use a good sunscreen of SPF 30 and repeat application every 3 to 4 hours Take antioxidant and vitamin C supplements.  You can apply Costco cream at nighttime over the affected area.  You need to consult a dermatologist as dermatology being a visual field, the cause for your pigmentation and the treatment required can only be suggested after proper skin examination.  Chemical peeling can give you good and long-lasting results.  Take care.",

I understand from your query that you are having unilateral ptosis. This is most likely to be due to weakness of the muscle that lifts the eyelid (levator palpebrae). This muscle is supplied by a nerve called the 3rd nerve or the oculomotor nerve. There are many causes for weakness of the 3rd nerve. Some of them are diabetes, high blood pressure, stroke, tumor, etc. You need to consult a neurologist who will examine you and may advise you to get an MRI scan of the brain to find out the cause. If it is due to diabetes or high blood pressure, then it can be treated with medicines. If it is due to other causes, then you may need surgery. Please do not worry, you will be fine. Hope this helps you. Take care.",

I am attaching my prescription for your reference.\n\n### Response:Hello, I have gone through your query and understand your concern. I think you are having exotropia in your right eye. It is a type of squint in which the eye turns outward. It is usually congenital and often bilateral. Usually, the vision in the squinting eye is normal. But sometimes, the eye turns so much that the cornea (clear front cover of the eye) of the eye touches the sclera (white part of the eye). This constant rubbing of the cornea causes the cornea to become opaque at the center and causes loss of vision. This is called amblyopia. Amblyopia is a treatable condition. If the exotropia is mild, vision can be improved by wearing glasses with prism lenses. If the exotropia is more than 30 to 40 degrees, vision can be improved by surgery on the extraocular muscles. In your case, you have to undergo LASIK surgery first, then a month later, a squint correction surgery. I think you should go for that. Hope this helps. Please write back for further queries. Wishing you good health.",

While in hospital, she contracted C.diff and has had several recurring bouts with it. She has had a transplant and so far she is doing well with no recurrence. She also has a fistula near the rectum from an abscess. They put in a tube to keep it open and flowing. She has always had bouts of constipation and diarrhea for years before the accident. Her cognitive functions have been diminishing. One of my brothers is living with her and care taking her for full time.She is very weak, but can walk with the aid of a walker. Before the accident, she was fine. But, she may have shown a few signs of slight memory issues and balance prior to the accident as well. Our main issue right now is loose stools with some fecal incontinence. The doctor said that the fecal incontinence is because of a weak rectum that will not hold back fecal matter. Also, the fistula is always draining. When her stools are normal, she has good energy and cognitive function. When she has loose stools, she is very weak and can hardly stand or walk. Her cognitive function is a lot worse. She gets very confused about daily items and memory issues.We are looking for supplements to keep her regular and avoid the loose stool episodes. These are recurring every other week. Being so weak at the time of an episode, the toilet and the surrounding area get very filthy. She has little control and not able to clean herself properly. Her diet is pretty good. We are trying to keep dairy items away, limiting sugar and some carbohydrates as best as we can.We are giving her Metamucil when she has loose stools as well as some ammonium. This seems to have very limited success. She is on a blood pressure medicine as well as on Coumadin. So, we have to watch for interactions between everything. Regarding supplements, right now she is taking Alpha-GPC, Prevagen and multivitamins B for cognitive help, Fish oil, turmeric and Centrum multivitamins.Any help or suggestions to prevent the loose stools without creating constipation would be appreciated. I would also like to increase her core energy, so she will feel more like moving around. We have a physical therapist at once a week.",

This seems to have very limited success. She is on a blood pressure medicine as well as on Coumadin. So, we have to watch for interactions between everything. Regarding supplements, right now she is taking Alpha-GPC, Prevagen and multivitamins B for cognitive help, Fish oil, turmeric and Centrum multivitamins.Any help or suggestions to prevent the loose stools without creating constipation would be appreciated. I would also like to increase her core energy, so she will feel more like moving around. We have a physical therapist at once a week.\n\n### Response:Hi, Thank you for posting your query. I have noted the details of your mother. She has a few medical issues, and is on multiple medications. Her current problems are related to the brain injury after the fall, and also the fistula in the rectum. I agree with the current treatment being given to her. I would suggest that she be given a high protein diet, with plenty of fluids. Also, she should be made to sit in a tub of lukewarm water for 10 minutes every day, to keep the perineal area clean. I hope my answer helps. Please get back if you have any follow-up queries or if you require any additional information. Wishing you good health, PMC-LLaMA. Ly/",

You cannot use the abortion kit at home. Please do not try self-medication. It is not safe and can lead to serious complications. The medical abortion can be performed up to nine weeks of gestation. A trans-vaginal sonogram is done to confirm the age of the pregnancy and to plan the treatment. You will be given tablets of Mifepristone and Bisoprolol to initiate the process of termination. Follow-up sonogram is done after 48 hours to confirm the completion of the abortion. Hope this helps.",

Started exercising and lost weight and inches, 198 lbs to 178, 38-inch waist to 32. Symptoms still persisted. The doctor started me on Clomid 50 mg three times per week.Testosterone shot up to 900\\s but symptoms persisted although Cialis helped with erection quality, still low libido. Will attach a note with test and A1c results during this time. So, I stopped taking the Clomid in March this year and had my physical last week.The doctor says my testosterone is 570, A1c is 6.0 and everything else looks good. He says since I still have symptoms, that I have testosterone resistance. His analogy was; like diabetics, their bodies produce insulin but just does not know what to do with it.So, his treatment recommendation is TRT testosterone replacement therapy along with Clomid. I am hesitant because I feel this therapy is overused nowadays, and I feel pretty good except my libido.Sought a second opinion today from my urologist, he seemed disinterested in me doing that but said if I try a few injections it would not hurt me, then advised me to run this by an endocrinologist.So I guess in summary:Do you believe that testosterone resistance is a valid diagnosis?If I do try the TRT, can I stop after a few weeks or a few injections and get back to the way I am right now with no permanent issues?Should I just start the Clomid again, or just keep using the Cialis and keep working out and trying to clean up my diet more?Any other thoughts and advise would be appreciated.

So, I stopped taking the Clomid in March this year and had my physical last week.The doctor says my testosterone is 570, A1c is 6.0 and everything else looks good. He says since I still have symptoms, that I have testosterone resistance. His analogy was; like diabetics, their bodies produce insulin but just does not know what to do with it.So, his treatment recommendation is TRT testosterone replacement therapy along with Clomid. I am hesitant because I feel this therapy is overused nowadays, and I feel pretty good except my libido.Sought a second opinion today from my urologist, he seemed disinterested in me doing that but said if I try a few injections it would not hurt me, then advised me to run this by an endocrinologist.So I guess in summary:Do you believe that testosterone resistance is a valid diagnosis?If I do try the TRT, can I stop after a few weeks or a few injections and get back to the way I am right now with no permanent issues?Should I just start the Clomid again, or just keep using the Cialis and keep working out and trying to clean up my diet more?Any other thoughts and advise would be appreciated. Thanks.\n\n### Response:Hello, Testosterone resistance is a rare condition. I would suggest you to get your testosterone levels repeated after 2 months. If they are still low then only you should go for TRT.  If they are normal then you can stop it.  You can also try Closed and Calls.  You should also get your prolactin levels and thyroid profile checked.  Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care PMC-LLaMA.",

You have mentioned that you have responded to venlafaxine XR. Venlafaxine XR is an SARI (serotonin and nor epinephrine reuptake inhibitor). It means it increases level of both serotonin and nor epinephrine in brain. Increase in these neurotransmitters level is responsible for improvement in your symptoms. On the other hand, SSRI (selective serotonin re uptake inhibitor) only inhibit serotonin reuptake. As you have mentioned that you have not responded to SSRI, so it is obvious that you will respond to SARI. Regarding increasing the dose of venlafaxine XR, you can increase the dose after consulting your psychiatrist. But do not increase the dose by your own. It can lead to adverse effects. I hope this information has been both informative and helpful for you. Wish you Good Health.",

        "input": "Hi doctor,One year back, while sitting on a chair in office I felt as if my back got stuck and was unable to move. I took two painkillers and managed to sit there for a while, but after two to three hours the pain started radiating to leg. I was diagnosed with moderate disc herniation at L4-L5 and L5-S1. I was advised to take bed rest for three months and felt better after five months. Then I got some manipulation done with my lower back and my condition got worse. After that I had slight pain in my tail bone while walking and the pain got worse when I sit for five minutes. It got radiated to hips, thighs and it was worse when I stood up from a sitting position. Then I left with no option except bed rest for another four months that is a total nine months of bed rest. After that I suddenly started walking two to three hours a day in a stretch and started doing some exercises. After few days of getting my body too much into motion I felt my upper back getting stuck and again was unable to move and the pain radiated to my wrist and hand. Then had bed rest for another 10 days and felt a bit better. But, still in pain and resumed with two to three hours of brisk walking and exercises. I noticed that many joints in my body were making cracking sound while I walk or move my body and they were continuous. They are not going away no matter how much I move that joint, the cracking sound will repeat infinite times whenever I move my body. The cracking sound is mostly from lower and upper back, shoulder, ankle, foot fingers, knees also make that cracking sound and it is painful as well. Cracking sound in knees are felt more when I start walking after being in rest state and frequency of cracking sound reduces after walking for two to three minutes.I got my ESR and CRP checked. They are normal, but there is a slight increase in lymphocytes and RBC. Now, I have been suffering from this continuous cracking sounds and pain in almost all my joints for more than a month now. I also suffer from severe pain in tail bone area. Also suffers from some sensation loss (not persistent) in left side of my upper left leg, pain in groin area (but not anymore), pain in lower back and upper back. Also a few days back a physiotherapist did some manipulation, which again increased my problem and after that when I wake up in morning both my hands are badly at asleep. Doctors say that discs are hydrated and it is rather some other thing which is causing me problems but are unable to diagnose. The amount of rest I have taken and all those manipulations have gone through have only done badly rather than doing any good. I am only 27 years old and unable to do simple tasks like sitting for five minutes. Please help me, what could be the possible reason for all this.I had some back pain three years ago. My lifestyle is also not good. I do not used to any exercise or walk earlier, only sitting on a chair in front of a computer for 10-11 hours. I have also gained weight of 15 kg in 10 months. Right now, I am taking only Vitamin D3 supplement. I am attaching all my reports for your reference.",

In my opinion take fresh fruits (banana, apple, orange) and fresh vegetables. As fiber content is very important in such cases. 3 Psychological factor is also very important in such cases. As in teenage group there are so many changes in body, mind, hormones, so due to this also constipation may be the cause. In my opinion consult a physician and get his opinion. Good luck.",

Pneumonia is lung infection and common symptoms are cough, chest pain, fever, weakness, fatigue, breathing difficulty etc. So better to consult doctor and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and chest x-ray. If chest x-ray is normal then no need to worry about pneumonia. Take simple antibiotic like amoxicillin and paracetamol for 5 days. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.",

The pain and burning sensation while passing urine is due to residual UTI. Please get your routine urine test and urine culture done to find out the organisms causing this infection and antibiotics to which they are sensitive to. Please take broad spectrum antibiotics like Definite along with urinary antiseptic like Nitrofurantoin twice daily and urine alkalizer thrice daily. Later on switch on to appropriate antibiotics as per culture report. Get the prescription of medicines from your family Physician. Ensure to PMC-LLaMA.

If you have been on treatment for more than 6-8 weeks, then I would suggest you to consult a psychiatrist for re-evaluation of your treatment. In that case, I would like to start you on venlafaxine or mirtazapine. Both these",

As per your complaint pain in jaw and around the filled tooth after filling can be due to infection that is still left in tooth and is a clear indication that the filling has been done over decayed tooth and not over the tooth that had a cavity due to wear and tear. You need to consult an ENDODONTIST and get evaluated and in case if tooth can be saved root canal treatment can be done followed by antibiotics and painkillers. In case if tooth cannot be saved extraction is advisable. As of now you can take anti-inflammatory painkillers like Ibuprofen for pain relief. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards.

        "input": "Hello doctor, For ten years, my husband has been successfully using an extended wear bandage contact lens (monthly wear) to control the pain of aphakic bullous keratopathy in one eye. About seven months ago, he had an episode of foreign body pain in the eye which the contact lens could not control. His optometrist changed the type of lens after remarking that the lens appeared tight. Although the painful sensations have decreased, they are still present with more of a sore feeling now. His ophthalmologist suggested that he discontinue the Azopt drops he had been using in case the preservative was causing some corneal toxicity. His eye pressure without the drops has read at 18 and 20 on separate occasions, but he does have corneal edema which may affect the measurement. He has had high pressure in that eye previously, but it was mostly lowered by Cyclodiode treatment some eight years ago. The consultant said he had left him on the Azopt drops just as a precaution. My query is that if the bandage lens has worked so well for pain management for 10 years is it possible that it can continue to work? And if the Azopt drops and their preservative had caused some toxic reaction seven months ago, could that still be causing him to feel the discomfort? His consultant suggested out that he could have the eye removed to control the pain, but as he has what he feels is some slight, useful vision in that eye, he does not want to take such a drastic and life-changing step. In fact, he wants to pursue the least invasive course of action to relieve the pain he is getting. I would appreciate any advice you could give as he is in quite a bit of pain.",

In your case, you are having obsessive thoughts about porn and porn stars. That is not depression. That is obsession. Anxiety is also part of obsession. You need to learn to manage your obsessive thoughts. For that you should consult a psychologist. If you require more of my help in this aspect, Please post a direct question to me in this website.

The end result was diagnosed as a blighted ovum. So, it was evacuated by D and C.Our daughter is of normal build and nutrition. Her menstrual history was normal since the beginning in terms of cycle, duration, and flow. But, one month after D and C, she did not have her period. On the doctor's advice, she took some medicines and bleeding occurred. She was known hypothyroid. So, she was taking Thyroxin 50 or 75 to keep the TSH near about 2.5 Uiu/ml. Her Hb % and sugar are within the normal range.Again, she tried to conceive since three months ago along with Aspirin and folic acid. She missed her period last month. Her beta hCG was 9.20 mIu/ mL.

Do a thyroid profile and prolactin levels and an ultrasound for her uterus and ovaries.  If everything is fine, she can try naturally for 6 months.  Be in contact with your husband every 2 to 3 days after your periods stop.  It will increase chances of your pregnancy.  If it doesn't work then you can go for ovulation induction with timed intercourse.  In this you will take medicines for growth of your follicles and track your follicles' growth by repeated ultrasound.  When follicles reach a size more than 17 to 18 mm, take injection for rupturing the follicles.  Be in contact with your husband for 2 to 3 days after injection.  Take progesterone for next 2 weeks.  Do a urine pregnancy test at home after that.  You can try like that for 3 to 6 months.  Hope I have answered your question. Regards PMC-LLaMA.",

A thorough musculoskeletal assessment is advised. As you have a doubt that the elbow is broken, and you do not have pain as well, then it is not broken. Because if it was broken you will have pain even at rest. Also, if you are able to flex and extend the elbow joint with no pain then it is not broken. In case if you have doubt then you can go for an MRI of the elbow joint which will help understand the soft tissues better. Usually, in my clinical practice, patients do have pain and restricted movements of the elbow joint, for which we take up an x-ray to see if any fracture is present and then plan the treatment accordingly.

I honestly do not understand the benefits of a ketone diet, what are they? Is a ketone diet good for those who are diabetic?\n\n### Response:Hello, Thank you for your query. Ketogenic diets are very low in carbohydrates and high in fats. They work by changing the metabolic state of the body from burning glucose to burning fat. This leads to a decrease in insulin levels and an increase in the release of the hormone glucagon. Glucagon stimulates the liver to convert stored glycogen into glucose, which is released into the bloodstream. The brain, which normally requires glucose, begins to use this alternate source of energy, the fatty acids. These fatty acids are converted to ketones, which can be used by the brain and other tissues for energy. Ketogenic diets can be beneficial for weight loss, improving blood lipid profiles, treating certain metabolic disorders, and improving blood sugar control in patients with diabetes. However, there are some potential adverse effects of prolonged use of this type of diet, including the following:1. Increased risk of heart disease due to the high levels of cholesterol and triglycerides that can occur with this type of diet.2. Increased risk of kidney stones due to the high levels of uric acid that can occur with this type of diet.3. Insufficient intake of vitamins and miner",

Please explain.\n\n### Response:Hi... Thank you for consulting in PMC-LLaMA. Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15\u00a0mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500\u00a0mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol. Hope my answer was helpful for you.  I am happy to help any time. Further clarifications and consultations on PMC-LLaMA are welcome. If you do not have any clarifications, you can close the discussion and rate the answer. Wish your kid good health.",

Strattera (Atomoxetine) is a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) like Effector (Venlafaxine). Taking these medications together can cause severe side effects including high blood pressure, rapid heart rate, sweating, tremors, confusion, and changes in mental status. You may need a dose adjustment or special tests to safely use both medications. Please consult with your treating doctor to prescribe alternate effective but a safer medication. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further.",
