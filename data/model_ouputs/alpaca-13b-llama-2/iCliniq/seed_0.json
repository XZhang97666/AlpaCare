If I do not have sex for days, they become sensitive. I was treated with Ceftum 500 mg, the first time I had an infection.

In the meantime, you can take a course of antibiotics as a precaution. As for the pain you feel after sex, it is possible that there is some inflammation in the area that could be caused by a blockage in the vas deferens. This should also be examined by a doctor.",

I have stopped using soap and also took Clonafit 0.25 mg and Betonix- 10 prescribed by a dermatologist but there is no improvement. Please help me out of this.\n\n### Response:It is likely that you are suffering from a type of allergy. The itching could be caused by an allergy to an ingredient in the soap or a reaction to heat and sweat. The medications you have taken are anti-histamines which help reduce the symptoms of allergic reactions. However, it is possible that the dosage may not have been strong enough to provide relief. You should visit a dermatologist again and get the allergy tested. Based on the results, the doctor may prescribe a higher dosage of the same medication or a different one. In addition, you should avoid using soaps with potential allergens and limit exposure to heat and sweat.",

For the past 3 months, I have been experiencing this facial tightness which comes pretty often throughout the day with different intensity. The facial tension usually comes half an hour after I leave the bed. The tightness on my face happens to be on both sides of my face but usually more intense on the right. At times, I can feel it from my neck all the way up to my face. As of recent, I have been feeling this slight burning sensation on my chest to my shoulders as well. Prior to this facial tightness, I have been suffering from this burning feeling on the centre of my chest for about a month. It was my first time experiencing heartburn and I thought it was heart related. Went for X-rays and echo heart ultrasound. Everything came out fine. I have a healthy heart. What made the burning chest sensation go away temporarily is lying down, eating, exercising and drinking alcohol. And the weird part is the same thing helps me relieve my facial tightness temporarily is the same thing as that for the burning chest sensation; lying down, eating, exercising and drinking alcohol.Since having this facial tightness, I have paid numerous visits to different doctors, even the neuro-specialist and they all said it was anxiety. The doctors did facial senses test where they take a piece of fine cotton to touch different parts of my face. I had to close my eyes and tell them where the spot is. I have no troubles at all. I did blood test. It came out normal. They told me I do not need to do any scans and that it was merely anxiety and it will go off by itself. I convinced myself that I had anxiety because of the one month heartburn ordeal that I was suffering from. Even though the facial tightness was there, I tried my utmost best to ignore it. I do not think that I have any anxiety in me now as I try not to think of the weird tightness sensation. However, it has been 3 whole months and now I am getting alarmed and worried that it is still here and with newer sensations as I described above. In all honesty, I do feel that the intensity of the facial tension as compared to I first experienced it, is less. However, it is always there even as when I am typing this. I do not see any physical change on my body. Not sure if it is neuro damage. I am worried sick.Hope I can get some form of advice and diagnosis.",

This could be causing your facial tightness, burning sensation in your chest, and other symptoms. It is important to get properly diagnosed so that you can receive appropriate treatment. Your doctor may recommend tests such as an electrocardiogram, blood pressure measurements, or a tilt table test to assess your autonomic function. You should also discuss any anxiety or stress you may be feeling, as this could be contributing to your symptoms.",

In general terms, it was informed about TB in her abdomen. Accordingly, medicines were given to her as per the advise of a local MD doctor. Treatment continued for three months and due to some discontinuation of medicine it relapsed and again she was diagnosed with Thicken bowel loop as per USG. Again treatment continued.However, while undergoing treatment she lost sensation in her legs and complained of losing sensation in her legs and numbness in her feet and was unable to put on slippers in her feet with difficulty in moving. She also complained that while moving she felt as if she was moving on a bed of soft cotton.Subsequent treatment by neuro experts revealed that overdose of treatment of her TB in abdomen resulted in this condition and she was diagnosed for peripheral neuropathy and was advised for biopsy for proper diagnosis. Meanwhile, she fell and hurt herself which was later on diagnosed that her spine at L3 - L4 was compressed due to felling abruptly and accordingly she was advised to take bed rest for three months. Slowly, she recovered from this condition felt pain in her back and was facing another kind of problem as she could not sit for a longer time and preferred to lay down on the bed.Finding her bad condition subsequetly, we also took consultation from other neuro experts at a prestigious institution where she was prescribed Lupivitin one tablet and Sammy one tablet.When condition persisted thereafter she was given Primosa one tablet daily, Neurox one tablet daily, Maxglobin 50 mg one tablet and Defart 6 mg.But, whenever she was given medicine her condition further aggravated. After about six months of treatment by the neuro expert, she has now been referred to the department of immunology for their advice. Meanwhile, we also took advice from a rheumatologist who diagnosed a kind of arthritis and started treating accordingly. He also started the course of Defzacort (steroid) along with other medicines. The steroid was prescribed with a decreasing dose per week from 60 mg per day to 6 mg per day.However, after taking about two months of steroid course her condition deteriorated and had severe breathlessness. Her blood sugar level also shot up and ultimately she was hospitalized and the treatment of steroid withdrawn. After 15 days of treatment at the hospital she recovered to her previous condition.

It is also possible that the overdose of TB treatment caused this condition. Her spine compression at L3-L4, caused by a fall, may be exacerbating her symptoms. \n\nIt is concerning that her condition worsened after taking various medications, and it is important to be aware of potential side effects and drug interactions. It is also important to ensure that she is taking the correct dosage of each medication and that the medications are appropriate for her condition. \n\nIt is positive that she has been referred to the department of immunology for further advice, and it is important to follow their recommendations closely. Additionally, it may be beneficial to seek a second opinion from a different neurologist or rheumatologist to ensure that the correct diagnosis and treatment plan is in place. \n\nI hope this information is helpful.

We ran a battery of tests when it first happened including TSH, EKG, lung scans, blood panels, etc. and everything was normal. So we went down the path of anxiety. Four years later, the symptoms continued. As my son now has a terrible fear of doctors, we tried a home blood test to get a full thyroid panel. I have attached the results.The blood work came back normal. Low normal TSH, but low normal T4 and lower normal free T4 and free T3. There is nothing that shows an abnormality. However, his urine test showed moderately low iodine and slightly low selenium. I have read that abnormalities in these measures could cause thyroid problems. What am I wondering is if these two indicators are worth further exploration with an endocrinologist knowing that going to the doctor will cause my son a severe panic.Also, is it possible that low iodine could have been a temporary diet thing and it is masking the signs of hyperthyroidism in the blood work?

The low iodine and selenium levels could be indicative of a potential thyroid problem and it is best to get it checked by a medical professional. Your son's symptoms could be linked to hyperthyroidism and it is important to get it confirmed. \n\nIt is also possible that your son's low iodine levels could be due to a temporary diet change, however it is best to get it checked by a doctor. If it is hyperthyroidism, it can be treated with medication and/or surgery, depending on the severity. \n\nWe suggest that you consult an endocrinologist as soon as possible and get your son's thyroid levels checked. It is important to rule out any potential physical causes for his symptoms and get him the necessary treatment.",

The fact that you can see better when you look out of the corner of your right eye could be a sign of a condition called pseudo-exophthalmos, which is caused by pressure behind the eye. This could be due to an infection, inflammation or a mass.

Now, pain has gone but slight liquid discharge and ear block is still there.

I recommend that you continue using the Otinex ear drops for another 3-4 days and if the issue is not resolved, then you should come in for a follow-up visit. Additionally, you can try using warm oil drops in your ear such as almond or sesame oil, which may help to reduce inflammation and clear up the discharge.",

Root canals are typically done to relieve pain, so it is concerning that your tooth is still in agony. I would recommend seeking a second opinion from another dentist to make sure that the proper procedures are being taken."

It is possible that the biopsies taken caused some bleeding, which could be the source of your discomfort. It is also possible that the biopsies may have caused some scarring, which could be contributing to the pain. You should speak to your doctor about any concerns you may have regarding the possibility of cancer.

The recommended dose of testosterone injections is 100-200mg per month, however, it is important to consult a medical professional to determine the appropriate dosage for you. Testosterone injections are usually made from an animal source, and can potentially affect your personality, energy levels, and other aspects of your health. Testosterone is not necessarily a lifelong treatment, but if you decide to stop, you may lose some of the effects.",

Additionally, non-alcoholic mouthwashes may be more effective at combating bad breath due to smoking, as the alcohol in alcoholic mouthwashes can mask the flavor of the product. Tongue scraping, in combination with a non-alcoholic mouthwash, is the best recommendation for those who smoke or drink, as it will help reduce bad breath and keep the mouth more comfortable.",

You should continue using the cream as directed and if the infection does not improve, you should consult a doctor for further evaluation and treatment. \nAs for your partner, it is unlikely that they would be affected by the infection as fungal infections are not typically contagious.

It is possible that you could be developing an infection, so it is important to monitor the situation and seek medical attention if the pain and swelling does not improve or worsens.

It is possible that the Cymbalta may be the cause of your Peripheral Neuropathy, however it is difficult to say without more information. Peripheral Neuropathy can sometimes be reversed, depending on the underlying cause, so it is important to get tested to determine the cause. In the meantime, it is important to manage your stress levels and take steps to reduce any additional strain on your feet, such as wearing appropriate shoes and taking breaks during your work shifts. \n\nI recommend speaking with your regular doctor to get tested for underlying conditions, as well as a neurologist who can help determine the cause and recommend treatments. Additionally, it may be beneficial to speak with a mental health professional to help manage your anxiety. \n\nI hope this information is helpful. Best of luck to you.",

It appears that you may be suffering from Periorificial Dermatitis, which is an inflammatory condition of the skin that results in red, swollen, and irritated skin around the mouth, nose, and eyes.

The best course of action would be to stop using any topical products on your face and refrain from using any harsh soaps or cleansers. You should also avoid using alcohol-based products on your skin. If the condition persists, it is best to consult a dermatologist who will be able to advise you better.",

From what you have described, it sounds like your friend may be suffering from a panic attack, which is a sudden feeling of fear and anxiety that can be triggered by a variety of things. The physical symptoms of a panic attack, such as shaking and difficulty breathing, are caused by the body's fight-or-flight response being triggered. It is important that your friend sees a doctor to rule out any physical causes for her symptoms, as the doctor mentioned that she is in perfect health. In the meantime, it may help to remind her that these symptoms are caused by her body's reaction to stress and fear, and not by an actual medical condition. She may also benefit from learning some relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation, that can help her to manage her symptoms when a panic attack strikes.",

It is important to maintain a healthy diet, as a balanced diet with the necessary vitamins and minerals is essential for growth. Glucosamine may help with joint health, but it is unlikely to have an effect on your height. It is important to ensure you are getting enough calcium and protein, as these are essential for growth. Milk and other dairy products are a good source of calcium, so it is recommended to drink at least one glass per day. It is also important to get enough sleep, as lack of sleep can affect growth. Additionally, it is important to manage stress levels, as high levels of stress can also affect growth. Exercise and physical activities can help manage stress levels and promote growth.\n\nHope this helps.",

Your doctor may recommend hormone replacement therapy to help increase your testosterone level. Erectile dysfunction is not necessarily related to low testosterone, so it is important to get checked out by a doctor to rule out any potential issues. Torsion could be a factor in your height, so it is important to get checked out by an orthopedic specialist. Additionally, holding your mobile phone in your pocket could have caused damage to the nerves in your area, which could have stunted your growth. Your defined leg muscles could be due to your short stature, but it is important to get checked out by a doctor to be sure. Finally, it is important to follow the doctor's instructions when it comes to fasting before a blood test.",

Unfortunately with labor day being this weekend I have been unable to see my regular OBGYN. But I did go to the ER to confirm the pregnancy 2 days ago. So my blood results came back with an HCG OF 248 and the doctor said I am right around 1-2 weeks.So, here is my question. I have been stressing out badly due to the fact I have been on Lorazepam 1 mg every night for anxiety and PD for the last 2 years as well as Percocet 10 mg as needed for back pain. I have been taking both of the medications during my pregnancy when I had no idea I was pregnant. Since finding out I have tried tapering on both medications. The Percocet is making me sweat and very agitated and when I tried to cut down on the Lorazepam I was shaking and almost hallucinating and delusion. I also tried not taking the Lorazepam at all and woke up crying, shaking and sweating. I want to be off both these medicines but I am worried more about the Lorazepam as it is a class D pregnancy drug. I have read about the terrible problems this causes for infants. I am so scared that I am considering abortion. I do not want to be a terrible mother before I even give birth. I have been having bad panic attacks over this and cannot seem to relax as the complications of these medicines are always on my mind. Any advice at all would be very much appreciated.",

But I did go to the ER to confirm the pregnancy 2 days ago. So my blood results came back with an HCG OF 248 and the doctor said I am right around 1-2 weeks.So, here is my question. I have been stressing out badly due to the fact I have been on Lorazepam 1 mg every night for anxiety and PD for the last 2 years as well as Percocet 10 mg as needed for back pain. I have been taking both of the medications during my pregnancy when I had no idea I was pregnant. Since finding out I have tried tapering on both medications. The Percocet is making me sweat and very agitated and when I tried to cut down on the Lorazepam I was shaking and almost hallucinating and delusion. I also tried not taking the Lorazepam at all and woke up crying, shaking and sweating. I want to be off both these medicines but I am worried more about the Lorazepam as it is a class D pregnancy drug. I have read about the terrible problems this causes for infants. I am so scared that I am considering abortion. I do not want to be a terrible mother before I even give birth. I have been having bad panic attacks over this and cannot seem to relax as the complications of these medicines are always on my mind. Any advice at all would be very much appreciated.\n\n### Response:It is understandable that you are concerned about the effects of the medications on your baby. It is best to consult with your doctor to monitor and manage your medications safely during pregnancy. Your doctor will be able to provide you with the best advice on how to taper and discontinue your medications, as well as manage your anxiety and pain. It is important to remember that abortion is a personal decision and you should consider all options before making a decision. There are many resources available to help you make an informed decision.",

However, it is important to rule out any potential medical causes, so it is best to get it checked out by a doctor. An examination and any necessary tests can determine if it is a harmless fat deposit or if there is an underlying medical issue that needs to be addressed.",

The best action to take would be to clean the area gently with warm water and a soft cloth, and then apply a small amount of petroleum jelly or aloe vera gel to help soothe the area. If the discomfort persists or she seems particularly uncomfortable, an over-the-counter pain reliever such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen may help. You should also keep an eye on the area to make sure that it does not become infected.

Want to be as conservative as possible to avoid further damage.\n\n### Response:Yes, there are conservative options available to fix this. One option is to add a layer of composite resin to the tooth, which can be shaped and polished to match the natural tooth. This can help even out the shape and texture of the tooth. Another option is to place a veneer or crown over the tooth, which can change the shape, size, and color of the tooth to match the others.

Your doctor will be able to give you a better idea of how many cycles you need. After the cycles are completed, you may be given a break before starting the next cycle, or the cycles may be given in a continuous manner. \n\nVomiting and lack of appetite are common side effects of chemotherapy, and your doctor can suggest ways to manage these symptoms. It is important to keep eating and drinking as much as you can to maintain your strength and help your body heal. \n\nIt is normal to feel depressed and demotivated during cancer treatment, and it is important to reach out for help and support. Your doctor can refer you to a counselor or therapist who can help you manage your emotions. \n\nThe itching over your breast could be a side effect of the chemotherapy, and your doctor can suggest ways to manage it. \n\nIt is too early to know if the breast will regrow, as it depends on the type of cancer and the extent of the damage.

Typically, a two-year-old should be able to understand simple instructions, recognize familiar words, and use simple sentences when speaking. It is also important to consider the context in which your daughter is speaking; if she is able to communicate her needs and understands simple directions, this may indicate that her language development is on track.

It is possible that your mother's exact issue and cure is related to thyroid function, so it would be worth exploring this further. You should speak to your doctor about the possibility of having your thyroid function tested more regularly, or even trying a trial of thyroid hormone supplementation to see if this helps to reduce your symptoms. If your doctor agrees, they may wish to adjust your medication dosage or try a different medication.

Unfortunately, it is hard to say if this is permanent or not, as it depends on the individual's skin type and how it reacts to the medication. If the hypopigmentation is bothering you, you can try using a topical cream containing hydroquinone, which is a skin-lightening agent that can help even out the skin tone. Other treatments such as laser therapy or chemical peels may also be an option. It is best to consult a dermatologist to determine the best course of action.",

This could be causing your penis to open slightly lower than the tip. As for its effect on your sex life, it could cause issues with ejaculation and sexual pleasure, so it is advisable to get it checked by a doctor. An examination and possibly a uroflow test could help determine the cause and severity of the issue.",

My resting heart rate is actually in the 40\\s. However, I do sometimes get palpitations and every once in awhile get a run of 5 to 7 in a row.

I have not had any palpitations since I began taking it a few days ago, but I want to make sure this drug is not putting me at risk for creating a dangerous rhythm.

You should also be aware of the potential side effects of Flecainide, such as dizziness, lightheadedness, upset stomach, and skin rash.

It is understandable that you are concerned about the potential effects of this surgery on your daughter's appearance. While it is difficult to say for certain without examining her, the maxillofacial surgeon should be able to provide an accurate assessment of how the procedure will affect her facial appearance. It is likely that some changes will be visible, but the surgeon should be able to minimize these as much as possible. It is also important to keep in mind that this surgery is being recommended to address a medical issue, and not solely for cosmetic purposes. We would advise you to discuss your concerns in detail with the surgeon and to get a clear understanding of what results to expect.",

It is positive that your hemoglobin is increasing, which indicates that the iron supplements are having an effect. It is also possible that the slight increase in your white blood cell count is due to the viral infection you had in the last week. Your neutrophils count is still within the normal range, so it is unlikely that you have an infection in your urinary system. However, it is best to finish the course of antibiotics that your doctor prescribed to be safe. It is important to continue taking the iron supplements as directed to increase your ferritin levels. You should also monitor your blood levels regularly to make sure that your treatment is effective. If you have any further concerns or questions, it is best to consult your doctor.",

At the age of 16, my blood report showed me a result of subclinical hyperthyroidism. I have done breast surgery. Due to my health concern, I always have my blood tested for thyroid.Before eight months, I also had done a Holter monitor, which showed my heart palpitations. On my final blood test, my thyroid results came normal. But still, I have the symptoms. I am trying for a baby. But I heard an issue that underlying or undiagnosed thyroid issue could become a terrible one during pregnancy. Do I need to consult an endocrinologist soon? Do these fluctuations are common in hyperthyroidism?\n\n### Response:Given your history of subclinical hyperthyroidism, it is important to monitor your thyroid levels closely, especially if you are trying to conceive. An endocrinologist can help you better understand your thyroid levels and determine the best course of action. Your symptoms could be related to an underlying thyroid issue, so it is important to get the proper medical care you need. It is also important to be aware of the potential risks of hyperthyroidism during pregnancy, so consulting an endocrinologist before becoming pregnant is recommended.",

My eyes are always dry and I suffer from allergies.

The red spot on the lacrimal caruncle could be an angioma, which is a benign tumor composed of blood vessels. Both of these conditions can occur due to dry eyes or allergies, so it is best to have them examined by an eye specialist to rule out any potential concerns.",

Unfortunately, it is not possible to rebuild the tooth and it will need to be extracted. Due to the mobility of the tooth and the presence of a large hole, there is a risk of further infection and damage to the surrounding teeth if the tooth is not removed. An implant would be the best option for replacing the tooth, however, if this is not possible, a denture or bridge could be considered.\n\nI recommend scheduling an appointment with a dentist as soon as possible for further evaluation and treatment.",

This condition is characterized by one or both of the eyes turning outward, which can cause diplopia (double vision).\n\nSurgery is often an effective treatment for exotropia, and can help to reduce or eliminate the double vision. The success of the surgery will depend on the severity of the condition, as well as other factors. Prisms may be used in conjunction with surgery to help reduce double vision, as well as eye patching and other vision therapy techniques.\n\nIt is also important to ensure that your prescription for glasses or contact lenses is up to date, as this can help to reduce strain on the eyes and reduce double vision.\n\nI recommend that you consult with an eye specialist to discuss your options in more detail. They will be able to provide you with the best advice based on your individual condition.",

The wisdom tooth oozes green pus if you apply pressure with a cotton swab. The decayed tooth is mildly painful. I saw my dentist a few days ago, who did not seem overly concerned. She slightly cleaned the gums around the wisdom tooth and prescribed me Cephalexin and sent me on my way. I have been taking Cephalexin for a few days, and yet the tooth is still oozing. My throat is red and irritated, the gums inflamed and there is no swelling in the mouth. Also, my nostril on that side is tender and painful. I am severely worried about the infection spreading to either my heart or my brain. In fact, I read an article a few days ago about a 26 year old who died from a tooth infection spreading.I do not have a fever. I have mild nausea. It is tender on that side of my jaw. The dentist had said the next thing she could give me was Clindamycin, but I have a fear of the side effects of that medicine. I already have heart problems and mild stomach issues. I have read that Clindamycin can cause severe gastrointestinal problems and arrhythmias. She also suggested Zithromax, but I have had heart palpitations while on that medication as well.

Additionally, if the infection is severe, an oral antibiotic may be necessary.\n\nTo prevent ingrown hairs, the patient should avoid shaving the area, use a gentle cleanser and exfoliator, and use warm compresses to promote drainage of the infected hair follicle.\n\nHope this helps."

It is possible that this could be a sign of Grave's disease, an autoimmune disorder that affects the thyroid, or a related condition such as thyroid eye disease. Treatment for this condition typically involves a combination of medications, radiation therapy, and surgery. It is important to get your mother the care she needs as soon as possible to ensure the best outcome.",

It is true that surgery to remove the tonsils and adenoids may be an option, but it is also true that some children do grow out of their tonsil and adenoid problems. Fluoroscopy is an option, but it is important to be aware of the potential risks associated with it. It is also important to be aware of the potential risks associated with not treating your son's OSA, such as fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and even behavioral problems. It is best to speak to your son's doctor to weigh the risks and benefits of each treatment option, as well as to get a better understanding of the severity of your son's OSA.",

We are planning for a child now but I am much worried. My height is 187 cm and weight is 102 kg.\n\n### Response:Thank you for your question. Premature ejaculation is a common male sexual dysfunction, and it can be very frustrating and embarrassing. It is characterized by ejaculation that occurs before or shortly after penetration, with minimal sexual stimulation. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including psychological and biological factors. \nTreatment options for premature ejaculation include medications, counseling, and certain sexual techniques. Medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can help to reduce the sensation of ejaculation and increase the control over it. Counseling can help to address any underlying psychological issues, such as anxiety or depression, which can contribute to premature ejaculation. Certain sexual techniques such as the stop-start or squeeze methods can also be helpful. \nIt is also important to ensure that you and your partner are comfortable with each other and that there is good communication between you. This can help to create an environment that is more conducive to successful sexual experiences.\n\nIn conclusion, premature ejaculation is a common male sexual dysfunction that can be treated with medications, counseling, and certain sexual techniques. Working with a healthcare professional can help to determine the cause and develop an appropriate treatment plan. Good communication between you and your partner is also",

It is possible that the fever is coming back because the bacterial infection has not yet been completely cleared. It is important to complete the full course of antibiotics as prescribed, even if the fever goes away. If the fever does not come down with Meftal syrup, you can also give her Paracetamol. Additionally, you can give her plenty of fluids such as water, soup, and juices to help her body fight off the infection. It is also important to keep her comfortable by providing her with adequate rest and ensuring that she is not overly exhausted.",

Your daughter's seizures should be monitored closely, and you should consult with a neurologist to ensure that she is receiving the appropriate treatment. As for your son, providing a balanced diet that is high in protein and other essential vitamins and minerals is recommended for healthy growth. There is no evidence that protein powder will increase their height, however. You should also keep in mind that final height is not determined until adulthood, so it is difficult to give an exact prediction at this point.",

The period of time between the missed pill at 8 AM this morning and the time that she will take the morning-after pill (around 4 PM)?Do you recommend taking today's pill today if she is also taking the morning after pill today?Is there anything else we can do now to minimize the risk?Should we be worried?Thank you.",

It is also possible for the length of your cycle to change when you are trying to conceive. It is important to track your basal body temperature and cervical mucus to get a better understanding of when you are ovulating. It is also important to be aware of any medications or supplements you are taking that may impact your menstrual cycle. If you are concerned, it is best to speak to your doctor.",

Since you have already stopped the cycle, it is recommended that you do a Post Cycle Therapy (PCT) to help restore your hormone levels to normal and minimize any potential side effects. During PCT, you should also monitor your hormone levels to make sure they are returning to normal. Additionally, it is important to note that increasing the size of the penis may not be possible through medication and supplements, and it is important to be aware of any potential risks associated with such treatments.",

Based on the information you have provided, it is likely that your mother is suffering from an allergic reaction to the Analgin (Novalgin) medicine. The swelling in her left forearm, general body pain, fatigue and mild sweating are all potential symptoms of an allergic reaction. It is important that she stops taking the Analgin (Novalgin) and seeks an alternative form of medication. The chest X-ray, blood tests and thyroid test all coming back normal is a good sign, however it is important to keep an eye on her symptoms and seek medical advice if they persist or worsen. It is also important to keep an eye on her thyroid levels and ensure they remain within the normal range. Hopefully with the appropriate medication and care, her symptoms will subside and she will be back to feeling her best.",

The sharp pains you are feeling when walking could be a sign of this. It is advisable to rest and ice the calf as much as possible, and if the pain does not subside, then it is best to get it checked out by a medical professional. Additionally, it is best to avoid any physical activities, such as your exams and weekend events, until the pain has completely gone away.",

On my lower left, I have a dry socket, which I am getting treated for via packing (at least I think that is what it is called). On the right side, healing is just fine, however, I noticed some white stuff lodged in the gum. I am not sure if it is food or scar tissue because when I tried to get it out with a toothpick, it did not come out very easily, so I left it alone. Is this food or scar tissue? It is mildly bothersome.I brush my teeth but know to be careful around the surgical sites so they do not get irritated. It seems like a lot of plaque builds up back there because of this, and I am not quite sure what to do. Also, there is a very small spot of red gums on the front side of my second molar. I put a bit of mouthwash on it with a toothpick and left it alone.I have two questions, what is the whitish stuff that feels like food trapped in my healing gum socket?

It's best to have it checked by your dentist or oral surgeon to be sure. The irritated gum could be due to plaque build-up or it could be an infection. Again, it's best to have it checked by a professional. As for the red gums, it's best to avoid putting any substances on it and leave it alone to prevent further irritation. You can try rinsing your mouth with a mild saltwater solution (1/2 teaspoon of salt in 8 ounces of water) a few times a day to help reduce any swelling or irritation. It's also important to brush and floss your teeth carefully around the surgical sites to prevent any further irritation. If the red gums do not go away or if you experience any other symptoms such as pain, swelling, or fever, it's best to have it checked by a professional.",

Missing your last shot three months ago could have caused the pregnancy, however, it is also possible to be pregnant even if you are on the shot. Home pregnancy tests are not always accurate, so it is best to consult a doctor to get a more accurate result. If you are pregnant, it is important to stop the Depo-Provera injections immediately. You should also be monitored closely by a doctor to ensure the health and well-being of both you and the baby.",

She was 5 lbs 10 ounces at birth and was healthy (did not have to stay in the NICU). She hit all of her milestones in terms of rolling over, crawling and walking (walked at 14.5 months), but is a toe walker. Her left leg (to us) is weaker than her right and her left leg does not bend as much as her right leg. She began to speak around 10 months of age then her speech left. We came to find out she had chronic fluid and a month back she had tubes placed. I am hearing more vowel and consonants now but no true words yet. She makes fine eye contact. Her non-verbal communication is good. She responds to her name but not always. She is beginning to learn more of what we are saying, she plays with some toys, is not terribly social. We are thinking that she may be on the autism spectrum and we have an evaluation soon to determine that. But my question is, could this be cerebral palsy?",

It is great that you are pursuing an evaluation to determine if she is on the autism spectrum, as this could be the cause of her delayed speech and social skills. It is also possible that she may have both cerebral palsy and autism, as the two are not mutually exclusive. It is important to remember that every child develops at their own pace, so it is important to focus on the progress your daughter is making and work with her to help her reach her full potential.",

Three days later, I started experiencing nausea, soreness of the breasts, lower back as well as abdominal pain, frequent urination, and tiredness. This carried on for almost a week.

On the third day, there was a slight discharge which was brown in color. On the fourth day, there was some bleeding, but not at night. Today would be day five, and I still do not see blood. My main concern is that my vagina feels different. It is more firm than usual and feels tight. I sometimes feel a pulling sensation. Could it be due to the morning-after pills?

The pulling sensation could be due to the tightening of the vaginal muscles, which is a possible side effect of the morning-after pills. The brown discharge could be due to the spotting that can occur with the use of the morning-after pills. It is also possible that the change in firmness of your vagina is due to the pill. The home pregnancy tests should be able to detect any pregnancy that may have occurred from the incident, so it is unlikely that you are still pregnant. If you are concerned, you can take another home pregnancy test to be sure. If you are still experiencing any of the symptoms you described, it is best to consult a doctor to get checked out.",

Healing from a herniated disc and associated surgery can take time, and it is good that you are persisting with physiotherapy and Ayurvedic treatment. It is difficult to give an exact timeline for when your foot drop will be completely cured, as this will depend on the severity of your condition and the progress you make with rehabilitation. Generally, it can take several months to a year to make a full recovery. It is important to be patient and to continue with your rehabilitation exercises. You should also consider seeing a specialist, such as a neurologist or physical therapist, who can help to guide your recovery. Good luck!",

However, the frequency of visits will depend on the severity of your condition and how well you are responding to treatment. In general, if you are taking a DMARD such as Methotrexate, you will need to have regular blood tests to monitor the levels of the medication in your system and to check for any side effects. You should also be monitored for any changes in your condition and for any new symptoms. It is important to continue seeing a rheumatologist even if you are feeling well, as this will help ensure that your condition is properly managed and that any necessary adjustments to your treatment plan can be made.",

It lasts a second or two but may repeat several times before stopping in five minutes or so. I went out in the garden today to dig a bit and wearing my HR monitor (I have got health anxiety, anxiety disorder as well as depression). As I was digging, the pain started hurting with each heartbeat. I looked at my monitor and it read 138 bpm. I am 70 years old and have been on medication (Benzodiazepines) for over 50 years for panic attacks and general anxiety. Two years ago I felt similar pain but not to this extent. I went to ER but nothing was found (the doctor said it could be costochondritis but definitely not my heart). I get bloodwork quarterly and everything was fine except cholesterol which was 235. I tried a statin but the muscle pain was too great. In my EKG I have RBBB or LAFB which 14 years back after a stress test I was told that I was probably born with it. I had gone to see the cardiologist then because of getting skipped beats and GERD he told me to ignore them. Last time I had an EKG was in the ER for six months when I had a weird pain in back and side. They checked out heart anyway and said it was fine. Probably just a colicky gallbladder. I have had stones for more than 20 years and had no surgery. So I hesitate to go to the ER again. My local doctor just closed. HR is still 88 while lying down right now. Usually, my resting heart rate is under 67. Currently, I am on Lorazepam 2 mg, Prevacid 15 mg and baby Aspirin.",

This can cause sharp chest pain that is worse with activity and relieved with rest. The patient should contact their primary care physician to be evaluated and ruled out for any potential serious causes of their pain, such as heart or lung problems. They should also inform their doctor about their medications and any changes in their health since their last evaluation.",

The decision to terminate a pregnancy is a difficult and personal one and ultimately it is your decision. Amniocentesis is a generally safe procedure, with a small risk of miscarriage, and can provide more information about the development of your baby. If the results are positive for Down\u2019s syndrome, you would have the information you need to make an informed decision. There are also other tests that can be done, such as chorionic villus sampling, which may provide further information. It is important to remember that a diagnosis of Down\u2019s syndrome does not necessarily mean that your baby will be mentally retarded, and you should discuss all the options and implications with your doctor.",

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.\n\n### Input:\nHello doctor,One week ago, I had intercourse on my third day of the period and after approximately 30 hours of that, I have taken an i-pill. From the next day of taking the pill, I had severe back pain and lower abdomen pain which continues for one week. And after one week, I started bleeding and right now do not know why I am still bleeding? Is it my period that came again?\n\n### Response:It is possible that you are still bleeding because your body has not fully eliminated the pregnancy. Taking the i-pill after 30 hours from intercourse may not have been enough time for the hormones to work, and the pregnancy may have continued. This could cause continued bleeding and back/abdominal pain. It is best to take a pregnancy test and if it is positive, seek medical help right away. If the pregnancy test is negative, the bleeding should stop within a few days and you can assume that the i-pill worked. However, if the bleeding continues for more than a few days, it is best to consult a doctor.",

Boils are often caused by bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, and can be accompanied by fever and lymph node inflammation. The boil may have been present before you shaved your face, but the shaving caused it to become irritated and inflamed. The boil may also be draining due to the pressure from shaving. It is important to keep the area clean and to avoid further irritating it. You should also consider taking antibiotics to help clear up the infection. In the meantime, it is best to refrain from shaving until the boil has completely healed.",

Additionally, I would like to run some more tests to rule out any other potential causes. Please make an appointment for further consultation and treatment.\n\nWishing you a speedy recovery."

However, it is important to keep in mind that ALS is a rare disease and there are many other possible causes for your symptoms. It is positive that your physical examinations, including reflexes, have all been normal. It would be helpful to monitor your symptoms and keep track of any changes. You could also consider getting a second opinion from a neurologist if you are still concerned.",

An endodontist can evaluate the tooth and determine if a root canal is necessary. If the nerve was exposed during the drilling, there is a good chance that the nerve is damaged and a root canal will be needed to prevent further infection and pain. A root canal is a routine procedure and a crown can be placed afterwards to provide further protection to the tooth.",

This can often be corrected with eye muscle surgery, which involves adjusting the muscles around the eye to correct the misalignment. The surgery is usually successful in improving vision and has a good prognosis in adults. It is important to see an eye specialist to determine the best course of treatment.",

Your heart rate of 98 bpm is within the normal range, and there is no need for concern. However, if your girlfriend is still worried, she could consult a cardiologist for further assurance. Additionally, you could get an ECG done to rule out any underlying heart problems. It is also important to maintain a healthy lifestyle with regular exercise, a balanced diet, and adequate sleep to keep your heart healthy.",

It is recommended that she takes a pregnancy test to rule out the possibility of pregnancy, and if necessary, she should consult a gynecologist to determine the cause of the delayed period. Taking the i-pill more than twice in a year is not recommended, so it is important to understand the cause of the delay and determine the best course of action.",

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.\n\n### Input:\nHello doctor,I weaned off of 40 mg of Paroxetine very slowly but my sleep was impacted and as of two months, I have been suffering from extreme insomnia. I have gone back to medication and I am currently on 20 mg of Paroxetine and 10 mg of Fluoxetine, but my insomnia has continued. I was prescribed Ativan (0.5 mg) for sleep, and it sometimes helps, but not always. Even if I take a bit more (I have taken up to .75 total), it does not always help me sleep. My psychiatrist prescribed Trazodone (she suggested I start at 25 mg and if I feel no effect, to take another 25 mg/ go up to 50 mg in one night (but I am concerned about serotonin syndrome from taking another medication that messes with Serotonin). Can you advise if I should be concerned about serotonin syndrome if I take the 25 (or 50) mg of Trazodone? Additionally, should I be concerned about anything else in terms of taking these three medications together?\n\n### Response:Given the medications you are currently taking, it is possible that you may be at risk for developing serotonin syndrome. Symptoms of serotonin syndrome include confusion, agitation, hallucinations, coma, increased reflexes, fever, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. It is important that you monitor for these symptoms and if you experience any of them, you should contact your doctor immediately. Additionally, you should be aware of the potential side effects of the medications, such as drowsiness, dizziness, and upset stomach, and consult with your doctor if they persist or become bothersome.",

In some cases, emphysema may not show up on a chest x-ray or chest CT scan, particularly if the condition is mild. However, a more detailed scan such as a high-resolution CT scan may be necessary to detect emphysema. Your doctor may recommend this if they suspect emphysema based on your medical history and physical examination.",

It is white color although, the one on the top started to have a slight pink color. But the second one on the bottom which is much smaller still has completely white color and around the vagina blades, I have a little while dots. Also, there are very tiny warts line along the blades. So, when I went to see the GP near my house he had a look and said that there is nothing to worry it is still small. But in my opinion, I think it is quite big. So the doctor gave me a prescription for Condyline paint which he told me to use for three days only per week and I have to keep using it for three weeks and if it does not get better he told me to see him again. Now I have a few questions. Is this mean I have an HPV virus inside my body? How can I make the virus go away permanently? Will Gardasil injection make it go away? If it does not go away permanently, how can I make sure that I have no HPV viruses and so these warts will not come back again? Is this mean that I have this HPV from my boyfriend? How to use Condyline paint correctly? I wash my vagina blades and use the cotton pads to dry it, then I use start to use the Condyline paint. I only dip the swab once into the reagent and then I open my vagina blades so that I am able to paint the two warts inside my vagina as much as I can. Then I paint it all over the very tiny warts in the vagina blades area. Am I doing it correctly?Now I have been using the Condyline for two days, but the very tiny warts that are around the vagina blades started to grow more. Is this mean anything? Can condoms prevent these HPV viruses? If I break up with my boyfriend, will this help my symptoms and health to become better? I am very scared of whether this can leads to cancer? I do not want this to ever happen to me again, how can I prevent this to happen again?If my warts are gone can I have sex with my boyfriend? Will these symptoms comeback again?

Firstly, it is important to understand that HPV is a very common virus and the vast majority of people who have it will never develop any symptoms or health problems. It is also important to remember that HPV is not the same as an STI, and it is not something that you can pass on to your partner. \n\nIn regards to your warts, it is likely that you have a form of genital warts which is caused by HPV. The Condyline paint that your doctor prescribed should help to remove the warts, however it is important to use it as directed. The three day rule is to ensure that you don\u2019t experience any skin irritation. If the warts do not go away after three weeks, you should visit your doctor again as you may require a stronger treatment. \n\nThe Gardasil injection may help to prevent further infection with HPV, however it will not get rid of the virus if you already have it. It is also important to remember that condoms do not provide 100% protection against HPV as it can be passed on through skin to skin contact. \n\nIf you decide to break up with your boyfriend, this will not necessarily help your symptoms or health, however it may help to reduce the risk of further infection with HPV. It is also important to remember",

Generally speaking, phimosis is a common condition where the foreskin cannot be fully retracted from the penis, and it is usually treated with topical or oral medications, laser therapy, or surgery. The blue-looking veins you mentioned could be normal variations or could be related to the phimosis. It is also possible that smoking marijuana is contributing to the veins appearing more prominent.

Yesterday after doctor visits heart palpitations for four hours got fed up and took one tablet one hour later, all palpitations and adrenaline rush was gone.

Had angio done approximately two years ago due to suspected heart attack or arrhythmia at home with all classic signs crushing chest pain jaw neck left arm down to the floor nauseated?Even with that lab test came back good the next day. Had carotid artery surgery two years ago to remove a piece of plaque in right carotid artery none found anywhere else no stent needed.

It is recommended that you take the Propranolol every day, as prescribed by your doctor, to help prevent the palpitations. If the palpitations return, you should take the medication as needed to control the symptoms.

I was told that the infection was not MRSA, but a \"slower moving bacteria\" they did not tell me what it was.

The swabs taken from your nose and butt before the surgeries may not have been conclusive, as MRSA can be present in the body without showing any symptoms. The best course of action is to finish the full course of antibiotics prescribed by your doctor and follow up with them for any further questions or concerns. Additionally, you can take preventive measures such as practicing good hygiene, avoiding contact with people who have infections, and regularly washing clothes and linens in hot water and detergent.",

Duphaston is a progesterone medication that can cause side effects such as spotting or light bleeding, and it can also cause the luteal phase (the second half of the menstrual cycle) to be extended. It is also possible that the cramps you are feeling are a sign of your body preparing for a period, but that the period itself is being delayed by the Duphaston.

Alcohol can impair the skin's ability to heal and can cause inflammation. Additionally, drinking more than two glasses of wine a day or a whole bottle can dehydrate the skin and make the side effects of the micro needling more pronounced. \n\nThe healing time for micro needling depends on various factors, such as the depth of needling and the individual's skin type. Generally, it can take up to 6 weeks for the skin to fully heal. Drinking alcohol can interfere with this process and delay the healing. \n\nIt is best to avoid alcohol during the healing process and to drink in moderation at all other times. If you have any further questions or concerns, please consult a dermatologist.",

Feeding your baby the expressed milk with a clean cup is recommended to avoid any risk of infection to the baby."

The main difference between the two procedures is that IntraLasik uses a femtosecond laser to create the flap, while Contoura Lasik uses a special topography-integrated laser to map the corneal surface in order to generate a unique treatment profile for each patient. Both procedures are highly successful in treating refractive errors, but Contoura Lasik offers more personalization and more precise corrections, resulting in better visual outcomes.",

It has been almost three weeks since I stopped Lyrica, Pregabalin completely for back pain. For the last week I have been experiencing something different which can be best described as random pressure or light pain almost behind both the ear lobes, sometimes the feeling is localized just there other times it travels towards the neck, occasionally towards the mastoid bone or it extends towards the lower jawline. I have been crazily searching to see if this is a result of any swollen lymph node fearing cancer but I could not find anything out of the ordinary on the body.

The pressure or light pain could be due to the inflammation caused by the infection. The heaviness behind the ears could be due to the buildup of mucus. It is also possible that the pain is being referred from the ear to the lower jawline.\n\nThe medicines you are currently taking are appropriate for the conditions you have mentioned. However, if the pain persists or worsens, it is advisable to consult a doctor for further evaluation and treatment.",

Implantation bleeding is usually lighter and shorter than a regular period and can occur anywhere from six to twelve days after conception. The bleeding may be accompanied by cramping and spotting, and the color of the bleeding may vary from light red to brownish. However, it is important to note that not all women experience implantation bleeding, so it is possible that the bleeding you have experienced is not related to pregnancy.

It is treatable with medicated shampoos, topical creams and oral medications. Your current medications are appropriate for managing this condition. It is unlikely to spread to other parts of the body, but it can be difficult to control and the flakes can be itchy and uncomfortable. You should continue using the medicated shampoo as directed and follow up with your doctor if the condition does not improve.",

This can be caused by an infection, irritation from shaving, or other factors. The clop-g cream you are using could be causing an allergic reaction, which is why the follicles become smaller when you apply it. It is best to stop using any creams or topical treatments and visit a dermatologist to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. They may recommend a different cream, oral medications, or other treatments such as laser therapy.",

The dentist was likely checking for any signs of decay or damage to the tooth on the x-rays. The slight change in color of the tooth could be a sign of dentinization, which is when the pulp of the tooth dies and the tooth turns a slightly darker color. It's possible that the tooth could be sensitive to hot and cold temperatures, so it's best to have it checked by a dentist to rule out any problems.",

The throbbing in your gums may be a sign of rebound inflammation, and the black color change could be due to deposits of tar from the tobacco. While these symptoms may not be serious, it is important to monitor them and keep track of any changes. An examination from a dentist or doctor may be necessary to rule out any more serious conditions. \n\nIn the meantime, good oral hygiene is recommended, such as brushing and flossing your teeth at least twice a day. Additionally, avoiding any further use of tobacco products is strongly advised.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nTake care.",

Night: Clozapex 25 mg half a pill, Mirtimash 30 g half a pill, Depakine Chrono 500 mg one pill, and Anafranil 75 mg half a pill.I used to take more but I stopped them over the past two years. For example, I used to take double the mentioned dose about nine months ago. I recovered from depression a couple of months ago. I started detoxing but with my doctor, the process was going way too slow and I have gained 45 kilograms over the past two years (25 in the past two months alone!) my muscles, my bones, and my joints started to hurt really bad because of my weight. Nothing works. I go to the gym every day, I workout but still I eat way too much because of the drugs and I cannot control it. My doctor does not want me to stop despite every hardship that I face and even refuses to decrease half a pill from the prescription. However, three weeks ago, I decided to cut all medications once and for all. I lost 7 kilograms, I stopped eating too much and just by cutting down the drugs I saved not less than 1800 calories per day. I started going to the gym more regularly. But here is the problem.Clozapex 25 and Mirtimash make me sleep and without them, I cannot sleep. No kidding, I have not slept in the past three weeks more than a maximum of 70 hours. Even those 70 hours, they are full of nightmares and I usually wake up after two hours with my mind confused and afraid and I cannot sleep back. I want to sleep. My eyes grew tired because I have been opening them for way too long. I do not want to give in and get back to the drugs because I am sick of them and I have had enough. I am not going back but I also want to sleep. Just a single continuous eight hours of sleep without any nightmares. I usually get nightmares that are very weird. I do not even know how to describe them. Mathematical problems and complicated solutions that are presented to me (in my sleep) and I keep thinking about them until my head hurts and I wake up freaked out. Please tell me what to do. I thought that after three weeks it would get easier but it is not getting easier. I have no side effects at all from any of the drugs only the disturbance of sleep.

It is concerning, however, that you have stopped taking your medications without consulting your doctor. Stopping medications abruptly can cause withdrawal symptoms, and in some cases, can be dangerous. It is important to work with your doctor to slowly taper your medications, as this can help reduce side effects and ensure your safety.\n\nIn terms of your sleeping problem, it is understandable to be concerned. It is possible that the medications you are taking are affecting your sleep, and it may be helpful to work with your doctor to adjust your dosages or try alternative treatments. Additionally, it may be beneficial to adopt healthy sleep habits, such as avoiding caffeine and screens before bed, creating a comfortable sleep environment, and ensuring you are getting adequate exercise during the day.",

It is possible that the change in diet and climate could be causing your son's discomfort when passing stools.

You can also try giving him a mild stool softener, such as polyethylene glycol, which is safe for infants.

The double rows of teeth can be caused by several factors, including genetics, and it is good that you have already had them extracted. Braces can definitely help straighten your teeth and bring them into a more aligned position, however it is important to wait until all the baby teeth have been completely replaced by permanent teeth before beginning any orthodontic treatment. Your dentist or orthodontist will be able to give you the best advice on the ideal timing for braces.",

I applied a lotion (Salicylic acid 16.7% and Lactic acid 16.7%), and the skin tag was removed. But, it came back after three months. Currently, I am suffering from genital warts and taking treatment.My doctor told me to get some test and here are the results. Lipid profile - triglycerides 125 mg/dL, HDL 35 mg/dL and LDL 113 mg/dL, CBC - lymphocyte 44%, serum amylase 121 IU/L, Helicobacter pylori IgA 0.45 (negative) and urine test - pus cells 3 to 4/HPF. Currently, I am taking these medicine as advised by my doctor. Zincolak one tablet twice daily, Zycolchin one tablet twice daily and Dicaris 150 mg one tablet once a day for three days.My question is that I am a healthy man with high immunity. I never get sick all around the year. How did I catch this infection? I have multiple sex partner, but I never had sex without a condom, or my condom never broke. Please give me a detailed answer and also give me advice for the treatment.\n\n### Response:Hello, \n\nBased on your description, it appears that you may have a weakened immune system, which could be why you are catching these infections. It is possible that you could have contracted the infections through skin-to-skin contact, even with a condom, or through other forms of contact such as towels or clothing. \n\nIt is important to continue your treatment and to monitor your health. You should also consider getting tested for other sexually transmitted infections, as well as taking steps to protect yourself from further exposure. This includes using protection during all forms of sexual contact, and avoiding contact with anyone who has an infection. \n\nI recommend speaking with your doctor to further discuss your results, as well as any additional questions or concerns you may have.",

Low sexual drive can be caused by many factors, including hormonal imbalances, stress, fatigue, and relationship issues. Medicines to increase sexual desire are often not recommended, as they can have side effects and may not be effective. Topical creams may be used to increase penile sensitivity, but it is important to speak with a healthcare professional before using any creams, as L-arginine may interact with other medications. Vacuum devices and penile injections are also available to help with erectile dysfunction.\n\nCircumcision can lead to a decrease in penile sensitivity, however this can often be treated with topical creams. It is important to speak with a healthcare professional to determine the best course of treatment.\n\nHope this helps.",

Sciatica is a type of nerve pain that originates in the lower back and can radiate down into the legs. It is often caused by a herniated disc or spinal stenosis, which can put pressure on the nerve root. Your doctor has prescribed the appropriate treatment which includes rest and physiotherapy. It is important to follow up with your doctor regularly to monitor your progress.\n\nIn addition, it is possible that the less walking you have been doing due to your bike may have contributed to your condition. It is important to keep mobile as much as possible, even if it is just walking.\n\nIf your symptoms do not improve with rest and physiotherapy, your doctor may recommend further tests or treatments, such as injections or surgery. It is important to follow your doctor's advice and not to ignore any of the symptoms.\n\nWe hope you feel better soon. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any further questions.",

It is important to note that insomnia can sometimes be a sign of an underlying mental health condition, such as depression or anxiety. If you are concerned about the potential risks of insomnia, it is best to speak with your GP as soon as possible. In the meantime, there are some things you can try to improve your sleep, such as sticking to a sleep schedule, avoiding caffeine, and creating a sleep-friendly environment. Additionally, you could try relaxation techniques such as meditation or yoga.",

Non-deglycyrrhizinated licorice can be a powerful tool for managing one's libido, however, it is important to be aware of the potential side effects, such as muscle aches and reduced potassium levels. To help mitigate these effects, it is recommended to consume foods high in potassium such as bananas, avocados, and apricots.

So, I thought I would consult with you on another question pertaining to my son. Unfortunately, a combination of my health anxiety and the big mistake of searching online has my mind imagining the worst with regard to my son. My son is 19 years old and has no diagnosed medical issues. I noticed back when he was about eight or ten years old that he had a mark resembling a cafe au lait mark on his back, in the upper shoulder area. I had always asked the pediatrician to look at it during his yearly physicals, and they made nothing of it. Throughout the years it has grown a bit and has become darker and more rough in texture. It is probably slightly less than an inch in length and looks like a few small lesions grouped together. Again, I have brought it to the pediatrician\\s attention and he was not concerned. Three months ago, I made an appointment for him and my other son with a dermatologist for a skin exam, and I pointed out the spots which I wanted to be checked in particular. We met with the physician\\s assistant there, and my younger son had a peculiar spot I pointed out, of which the PA conducted a shave biopsy, which came back as a mildly atypical junctional nevus. For my older son, I pointed out the spot on his back/shoulder, and the PA diagnosed it as a linear epidermal nevus. She said the chances of it becoming dangerous are slim to none. It may darken throughout the years, and they will simply monitor it at yearly visits. Unfortunately, I went on to research online about epidermal nevi and of course I ran into information showing a possible link to epidermal nevus syndrome and all of its associated neurological and skeletal defects. As I said, he is 19 and has no medical issues, is extremely intelligent, etc. In your opinion, is it safe to say that I should not be concerned about those syndromes? I presume it is primarily related to the numerous and systemic epidermal nevi, which he does not have, and I would think it would have presented by now? And my last even more neurotic question. My online research led me to some information saying that a certain type of epidermal nevus could be related to a gene mutation that could be passed along to an offspring, with them having possible serious skin scaling conditions, etc. Again, he has just one solitary small epidermal nevus. No biopsy was done, as the PA did not feel it was necessary. Do you feel there is any need for me to worry about that potential genetic mutation? Thank you so much for reading my long query.",

Based on the information you have provided, it is highly unlikely that your son has any of the associated neurological or skeletal defects with epidermal nevus syndrome. Epidermal nevus syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by multiple and systemic epidermal nevi, which your son does not have. The chance of him developing any serious skin scaling conditions is also slim to none. Additionally, since no biopsy was done, it is impossible to say with certainty that he has a gene mutation that could be passed along to his offspring. Therefore, there is no need to worry about that potential genetic mutation. In conclusion, it is highly unlikely that your son has any of the associated medical issues related to epidermal nevus syndrome.",

I started limping because my left calf, ankle and groin were hurting. My emergency Doppler venous ultrasound was clear. I had a D-dimer and that was negative. I had an MRI of my left ankle that showed a talofibular ligament sprain on my left ankle. I also had an arterial Doppler ultrasound that showed decreased flow of left anterior tibial artery and increased peak systolic velocity in the left common femoral artery. But, there was no stenosis, no sclerosis and no plaque. Could the sprain have caused that decreased flow? After three months, it became normal again. Then, while having pedicure the woman massaged my ankle and leg. Since then the pain has returned to my left ankle and left leg. I had another D-dimer done three weeks ago that was negative. I have also recently started experiencing cold left foot and a left cold lower leg at night. By morning, both the legs as well as the feet are of the same temperature. I do get pain in the buttocks and the pain is going down my leg like a sciatic pain on the left leg. Do I have peripheral artery disease? Could a blood clot be causing it?

PAD is caused by narrowing of the arteries, which can reduce blood flow to your legs and cause symptoms such as those you have described. A blood clot is also a possibility, and the arterial Doppler ultrasound and D-dimer test can help to determine this. It is important to follow up with your doctor to investigate further and receive any necessary treatment. In terms of your upcoming flight, it is best to consult your doctor to assess any risks associated with flying. Generally, it is safe for people with PAD to fly, but your doctor will be able to advise you on the best course of action.",

Otitis media is an infection of the middle ear that can cause symptoms such as earache, hearing loss, and discharge from the ear. It is usually treated with antibiotics, but in some cases, surgery may be necessary. In rare cases, it can lead to meningitis, so it is important to seek medical treatment if you are experiencing any symptoms.\n\nThere are several treatments available to help cure otitis media, including antibiotics, steroids, and surgery. The type of treatment recommended will depend on the severity of the infection and the patient's medical history. In some cases, a course of watchful waiting may be recommended to see if the infection clears on its own.\n\nIf you are currently taking antibiotics and are still experiencing symptoms, it is important to contact your doctor as the antibiotic may have triggered an allergy or the infection may be resistant to the medication. In some cases, a different antibiotic or a different type of treatment may be necessary.\n\nWe hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to contact us again if you have any further questions.",

The pain you feel when you touch your cheek is likely caused by the pressure being put on the nerve of the tooth. You should visit a dentist as soon as possible to have the infection treated and get relief from the pain.",

Panic attacks can be triggered by stress, but they can also occur without an obvious trigger. It is important to rule out potential medical causes, such as neurological conditions, so it is best to consult a doctor. Your doctor will be able to perform the necessary tests and provide a diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

Treatment typically involves rest, ice, compression and elevation, as well as anti-inflammatory medications and physical therapy.

This can cause difficulty in urinating, premature ejaculation, and frequent nocturnal emissions. An MRI would be the best way to confirm this diagnosis.

And I am serious about the removal if indeed it has lower radiation risk, even though I know kidney is very important. Please suggest.\n\n### Response:Thank you for your question. It is understandable to be concerned about the radiation exposure from the treatments you received for your kidney stone. It is difficult to say if removing the kidney would be the best option without more information, but it is important to remember that the risks of any surgical procedure must be weighed against the potential benefits. In terms of the radiation exposure, it is true that excessive exposure can increase the risk of certain cancers, however the amount of radiation used in your treatments is unlikely to have caused any long-term harm. It is also worth noting that the risk of cancer from radiation exposure is usually only increased when large amounts of radiation are used, so the amount used in your treatments is unlikely to be a concern.\n\nIn terms of other treatments, it is possible that a less invasive option may be available. For example, a procedure called extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) may be used to treat kidney stones without the need for radiation. This procedure uses shock waves to break up the stones into smaller pieces that can be passed out of the body. It is also worth noting that, while invasive treatments may have a higher risk of complications than non-invasive treatments, they may also provide a faster and more effective solution.\n\nOverall, it is important to weigh up the risks and",

Tendinitis is an inflammation of the tendons, which connect your muscles to your bones. The swelling and pain you are experiencing is a result of this inflammation. To help reduce the swelling and pain, you should rest the affected area, ice it for 15-20 minutes per day, compress it with an elastic bandage, and elevate it above your heart. You should also avoid activities that aggravate the tendinitis. If the pain and swelling does not improve within a few days, you should visit a doctor for further evaluation and treatment.",

However, since you are unsure if your partner ejaculated, it is best to take a home pregnancy test after two weeks to confirm.

It is also great that you are taking Prozac and Pantoprazole as prescribed.\n\nThe shadows in your far peripheral vision that move when you widen your eyes and move your head could be due to a number of things, including astigmatism, an issue with your retina, or even a neurological condition. It is also possible that the shadows are a result of your anxiety and depression, as mental health issues can often cause physical symptoms as well.\n\nThe aches that you feel around your eye and temple could be due to tension headaches, which are often caused by stress and anxiety. It is also possible that the aches are due to an issue with your eyes, such as astigmatism, or an infection.\n\nIt is great that you have been to ophthalmologists in the past and that they have dilated your pupils and looked at your retina and ocular nerves, as this is the best way to get a definitive diagnosis.

I used NSAIDs for a short period to avoid inflammation. I am also wearing crepe bandage. How long will it take to bring back normal movements? Please give suggestions.\n\n### Response:It takes approximately 6-8 weeks for a grade 1 ligament sprain to heal. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and crepe bandaging can help to reduce pain and inflammation, and promote healing. Physical therapy and exercises may also be recommended to improve the range of motion and flexibility of the leg. Depending on the severity of the sprain, your doctor may also suggest wearing a brace or cast to provide additional support and stability.",

What is the thick septation and how is it formed?4. What are the lesions in my lumen? I believe it is ovarian lumen. Do they form normally with ovarian cysts?

My son, who is 10 years old, also plays badminton and seemed to have milder tennis elbow. Do you like to give any suggestions for him? Thanks.\n\n### Response:Hello,\n\nBased on your description, you likely have a case of tendonitis, which is an inflammation of the tendons that connect to the elbow. This can be caused by overuse, such as playing badminton heavily. To help with the healing process, you should avoid activities that aggravate the elbow, apply ice for 20 minutes at a time several times a day, and perform stretching and strengthening exercises for the forearm muscles. You should also avoid gripping objects too tightly and keep the elbow in an elevated position when possible. For your son, it is recommended that he also takes a break from playing badminton and rests the elbow.\n\nApplying warm water or ice can help reduce inflammation and pain, but it is best to consult a doctor before doing so. Surgery is not typically recommended for tendonitis, so it is good that you are looking for non-invasive treatments. It is possible to heal from tendonitis without having to stop playing badminton for a long time, but it is important to take the necessary precautions and listen to your body.\n\nI hope this helps! Please feel free to contact me if you have any further questions.",

Additionally, since you are a virgin, you lack the necessary exposure to HIV that would allow transmission to occur. While it is understandable that any risk of transmission is concerning, the risk in this instance is minimal.",

It is understandable that you would want to find relief from the pressure you feel around your head when wearing glasses. It is possible that your discomfort is related to a muscular issue, in which case physical therapy or muscle relaxants may help. If the pressure is due to an eye problem, then glasses or contact lenses may provide relief. Additionally, you may want to consider other refractive surgery options such as PRK or laser eye surgery, as these procedures may be able to correct your vision without exacerbating the keratoconus in your right eye. Ultimately, the best way to manage your symptoms will depend on the cause of the pressure, so it is important to consult an eye care professional to determine the underlying cause.",

It is concerning that the wound from your recent Nesbit plication surgery is not healing properly. It is possible that the skin may grow back with time and appropriate wound care, however in some cases a skin graft may be necessary.

You are using the correct methods for wound care with Jelonet and gauze. \n\nTo speed up the healing process, you can try using a topical cream such as silver sulfadiazine or mafenide acetate. You should also keep the wound clean and dry, and avoid any activity that may cause friction or irritation to the area. Additionally, it is important to monitor the wound for signs of infection such as redness, swelling, drainage, or a bad smell. If you notice any of these signs, you should contact your doctor immediately. \n\nI have reviewed the picture of the wound and it appears to be quite deep. It is best to follow up with a specialist to assess the wound and provide further advice.",

Everyone has different genetic makeup, so even if you and your partner have the same blood type, it does not necessarily mean that you both have the same genes. The genetic makeup of your children will be a combination of your and your partner\u2019s genes, and their blood type may be different from both yours and your partner\u2019s.

However, if you notice any itching, redness, or swelling around the bite area, it is likely that you have been bitten by a bat. Bats are known to carry rabies, so it is important to get medical attention right away if you suspect a bat bite. To distinguish a bat bite from other insect bites, look for two small puncture wounds close together. Bat teeth are very small and may not cause any pain when they bite. Additionally, if you saw a bat flying nearby or noticed it land on you, it is likely that you were bitten by a bat.",

It is characterized by a high fever, cough, and shortness of breath. In some cases, hospitalization and oxygen support may be necessary. The use of asthma medications such as salbutamol HFA (Astalin) is commonly prescribed for bronchiolitis and is considered safe for premature babies. The nebulizer treatment and oxygen support should help your baby's condition improve. It is important to continue the treatment as prescribed by the doctor and to monitor his SpO2 levels. If the levels drop significantly or if the coughing persists for more than an hour, then it is advisable to seek medical attention immediately.",

What can I do to make sure this does not come back after it has gone.\n\n### Response:It is likely that the rash is a contact dermatitis, which is an allergic reaction to an irritant or an allergen. The medications you have been using (Fusidic Acid and betamethasone 20mg/g plus 1mg/g cream) are appropriate and it is good to see that they have been effective. It is recommended to continue using the medications until the symptoms have totally gone, and then discontinue use. Hydrocortisone 1% cream can be used as a maintenance therapy if needed, but it is important to be aware of the potential side effects and long-term complications. After the rash has gone, it is important to avoid any potential irritants or allergens to prevent a recurrence. \n\nIt is safe to use the medications as directed, and there is no need to be careful when washing your hair or face after touching the affected area. However, it is best to wash your hands after touching the affected area.",

It is important that you get medical help right away to determine what is happening and receive any necessary treatment. You should also get tested for sexually transmitted infections, as unprotected intercourse could have caused an infection.

Your doctor may have prescribed you drops to help with the dryness, but if you are still experiencing discomfort it is best to consult your doctor for further advice. Additionally, you should keep using the drops as prescribed and make sure to use the lubricating drops frequently to help alleviate the dryness.",

You should stop using the mouthwash immediately and look for an alternative teeth whitening method.

Started with constant sneezing followed by a runny nose, then nose cleared and sneezing stopped but felt an uneasiness in palate and throat turned sore, getting worse with time and then persistent coughing. I consulted my general practitioner on the fourth or fifth day who prescribed some medications. I started feeling better after the seventh day and the throat improved. But almost the next day onwards I started feeling worse again but this time it was not sore throat or a runny nose exactly, just felt the mucous inside throat all the time. Never felt feverish as such or found raised body temperature (by touching only) and experienced mild body ache here and there. Nevertheless, around 1 month after this resolved totally as said above, since yesterday I have started feeling same common cold symptoms, runny nose (not sneezing or coughing much though) with uneasiness in the palate, no raised body temperature but little feverish with mild body ache here and there.In both the aforesaid cases I had taken a Cetirizine tablet on the same day (but little later in the day) the symptoms started. But the medicine did not work. However, previously whenever I experienced a runny nose and constant sneezing, one Cetirizine tablet helped.In fact, it resolved the problem.

The hearing loss and ringing sound you are experiencing are common symptoms of a middle ear infection. It is best to see an ENT doctor to get antibiotic drops and rule out any further complications. The antibiotic drops should clear up the infection and restore your hearing.

It is good that you are monitoring your levels and taking steps to manage them, however, it is important to consider other potential causes of your leg pain.

For the past eight months, my sex drive is non-existent. I also have no morning erections. Factors that play a role are that I broke up with my wife and also eight months ago, I had serious accessory nerve operation that failed to fix my trapezius palsy, but I think these areas are physically too far apart. But maybe depression? I have not been able to think myself to be turned on. I have tried Zinc, Magnesium ZMA vitamin supplements which seemed to help for one week and I got hard morning erections. However, it stopped working. I have also tried Ginseng which does work as well as Tadalafil prescription works too. I can stimulate the penis with no medication too and ejaculate, but I usually have to look at porn (which I do not do often do because I have no libido, whatsoever). I have failed to have sex with three girls now because of lack of desire. I want to physically get it up, but it does not get up. I have ED, and I simply cannot get it up to beautiful women which is horrible.I have slight pain in both testicles which is I think because I have not masturbated. Feels like blue balls which are there when a man gets turned on but does not cum, so it hurts a little. No lumps are there on or in the testicles or anywhere else. No STDs of which I am sure because I had only five partners of which my ex-wife now was for last four years. All were protected sex. All tests came back normal. Only ECG said signs of hypertrophy but compared to ECG three years ago, not with any significant change so I doubt this is a reason. Also, note that the testosterone levels are fine.

It sounds like you may be experiencing psychological ED, which is ED that is caused by psychological or emotional factors, rather than physical problems. It is possible that the stress of your breakup and the accessory nerve operation have caused a decrease in your libido and ability to get an erection. It is also possible that the sleep apnea could be contributing to your ED. It is important to get tested for any underlying physical causes, as well as to address any psychological issues that may be causing your ED. Counseling and/or medication may help to treat any underlying psychological issues. Additionally, lifestyle changes such as exercising regularly, reducing stress, and getting enough sleep could help to improve your ED.",

Over-the-counter whitening products contain higher concentrations of hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide and are more effective at whitening teeth. However, it is important to use these products as directed and to consult a dentist before use. In the meantime, good oral hygiene practices such as brushing twice a day with fluoride toothpaste and flossing once a day can help keep your teeth looking their best.",

But, why are all these other people saying you can go years without showing positive and that is really freaking me out big time. Is it true that it takes years to come up positive or does it only take six months to know it 100 %? What is true? Also, there is a doctor who says no test is 100 % reliable.

Will my result change in the future? What is 100 % window period? Please clarify my doubts. Thank you.\n\n### Response:It is understandable that you are concerned and seeking clarification. It is important to understand that HIV is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) and the window period for HIV is three months after exposure. This means that it can take up to three months for HIV antibodies to develop in the body and be detected by a test. After the window period, if a person is HIV positive, they will test positive. However, it is important to note that no test is 100% reliable and it is possible to test negative even if a person has HIV.\n\nIn your case, it is positive that you have tested negative for HIV at 15 and 20 months post exposure. However, it is important to note that the test results cannot be conclusive beyond the window period. It is also important to note that the HIV-Alere combo test result is not a qualitative test and cannot be used to determine your HIV status.\n\nAt this point, it is recommended that you get tested again at 24 months post exposure to be conclusive. It is also important to practice safe sex and get tested for other STIs regularly.",

While it is possible for herpes to present itself as a painless pimple, it is important to note that herpes is a sexually transmitted infection and cannot be diagnosed based on symptoms alone. It is best to consult a doctor for a proper diagnosis and treatment.\n\nIn the meantime, you can try using a cream such as hydrocortisone cream to reduce inflammation and help the pimple heal. However, it is important to use any cream only after consulting a doctor.\n\nHope this helps.",

Is it true?\n\n### Response:Yes, it is true. The practice of edging, which involves stopping sexual activity before reaching orgasm, can help to extend sexual excitement and build up more intense pleasure when you do orgasm. This is because edging causes an increase in the body\u2019s level of sexual arousal hormones, which can lead to a more intense orgasm. However, it is important to note that this can be physically and emotionally taxing, so it is important to be mindful of your body\u2019s limits.",

How do you recommend using coconut oil in one\\s routine to reap benefits and avoid breakouts? If someone wants to use natural coconut oil on their face, what kind do you recommend using (i.e. unrefined, organic, etc.)?\n\n### Response:Coconut oil has been shown to have both positive and negative effects on the skin. On one hand, it has antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties that can benefit the skin. It can also help improve the skin\u2019s hydration and reduce symptoms of eczema. On the other hand, coconut oil can clog pores and cause acne. It is also very comedogenic, meaning it can cause blackheads and whiteheads. \n\nCoconut oil is best suited for oily and combination skin types, as it can clog pores and cause breakouts in those with dry or sensitive skin. If you do have oily or combination skin, it is best to use refined, organic coconut oil, as unrefined coconut oil can have a stronger scent and more impurities. When using coconut oil on the face, it is best to use a small amount and massage it into the skin in a circular motion. This will help boost absorption and reduce the chance of breakouts. Additionally, those with oily or combination skin should avoid using coconut oil more than once a day, and should wash their face thoroughly before bed to remove any residue.",

I have had folliculitis before in the same area and it was much different. She is the doctor. So I accepted and moved on. One small spot that has some hair growing back, small thin white hair. Yesterday, I noticed what appeared to be a bald spot in my pubic hair above the penis. When I trimmed the hair back, it revealed a quarter sized bald spot and a smaller dime sized spot. I am not sure how long they may have been there as they were somewhat masked by a longer pubic hair. So, now I have what I believe to be three spots, two below abdomen and one on beard. My concern is more of them spreading than the current spots.I am now thinking back about the annual checkup that I had with my GP six months back. I advised him that in the past year the amount of semen I produce has gone down drastically. I thought it may be a testosterone issue. He advised it was likely a result of my vasectomy the year before. Also as a part of my visit, my WBC was lower than normal, outside of the range by a couple. He was not concerned about that either.My question is whether any of these things are related: decrease in semen, low WBC, and alopecia in pubic area or all separate issues?

I also have male Incontinence and bedwetting problem since I was young and I am now 24 years old and a couple of times this year I found it hard to urinate, I felt like my bladder was numbed or something. So I went to a urologist and I had my testicles tested because I had pain there and thought it was the reason for all this. He gave me antibiotics I also did an ultrasound on my testicles and to check my kidney stones but everything was fine and after the antibiotics nothing change but the testicular pain.My urologist said he wants to do a TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate) but I do not know anything about the operation and he told me I will feel pain and I am scared of that but I also do not know why he wants to do this operation. I searched online and it says mercury retrograde might be from multiple sclerosis, week bladder muscle, problem with the nerves, a previous operation (does not apply to me) or medication side effect (does not apply to me).So I am not sure what to do? I want to check for multiple sclerosis and also look at my bladder muscles? Could it be a problem in the prostate? And is TURP necessary?

It is possible that you have retrograde ejaculation, which is when semen is ejaculated into the bladder instead of out of the penis. This can be caused by nerve damage, medications, or prostate issues. It is also possible that you have a weak bladder muscle, which could be causing urinary incontinence and bedwetting. Your urologist has suggested a TURP, which stands for transurethral resection of the prostate, and this is a procedure to remove part of the prostate gland. It is possible that your urologist wants to do this procedure to determine if prostate issues are causing your symptoms. Before proceeding with any treatment, it is important to get a full diagnosis and rule out any potential causes such as multiple sclerosis or nerve damage. It is also important to find a urologist who is willing to listen to your concerns and take the time to fully evaluate your condition.",

Further testing may be necessary to determine the cause of the patient's symptoms and to develop an appropriate treatment plan."

But I am afraid that over time they will grow in and be harder to look over.\n\n### Response:Hi,\n\nIt is great that you are taking an interest in your skin health. Moles are usually harmless and can form anywhere on the body, including the face. It is important to keep an eye on any new moles that appear, as changes in size, shape or colour can be a sign of melanoma, a type of skin cancer. Regularly checking your skin for new moles and any changes to existing moles is the best way to detect any potential issues early.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no way to prevent moles from forming or to slow down the process. However, there are some steps you can take to reduce your risk of skin cancer. These include wearing sunscreen, avoiding tanning beds, and limiting your exposure to the sun.\n\nIf you are concerned about the moles on your face, it is best to consult a dermatologist who can advise you on the best course of action. They may recommend laser treatments, freezing, or surgical removal.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nKind Regards,\n[Name]",

Regularly checking your skin for new moles and any changes to existing moles is the best way to detect any potential issues early.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no way to prevent moles from forming or to slow down the process. However, there are some steps you can take to reduce your risk of skin cancer. These include wearing sunscreen, avoiding tanning beds, and limiting your exposure to the sun.\n\nIf you are concerned about the moles on your face, it is best to consult a dermatologist who can advise you on the best course of action. They may recommend laser treatments, freezing, or surgical removal.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nKind Regards,\n[Name]"

        "input": "Hi doctor,I am a 23 year old male, a third-year medical student. For the past seven days, I have had an increased urgency and frequency to urinate. I can go even more than 30 times a day - majority of these times, I feel an increased urgency. However, when I go, only a small amount or drops come out. For the past two to three days, the urgency kind of feels to be getting worse, I feel as if I will not be able to hold it. However, I am still able to as there is no leaking. There is no burning or irritation or any discharge. No recent sexual encounters and no other associated symptoms. I take Coveram 10/10 for essential hypertension and Valdoxan 25 because I also do suffer from anxiety. I have been under stress lately as I was doing my exams this past week and finished today. I have done a few tests at my family doctor: Last week I did a dipstick which was normal apart from +1 protein. Voiding bladder US was normal (450 mL pre voiding, 45 mL post voiding). An initial urine culture was normal according to my doctor. Yesterday, I performed another dipstick and urine culture. The dipstick was normal, and early urine microscopy showed 10 to 100 white cell count. We are waiting for the cultures to return. Due to the result of the white cell count, my doctor said it would be worth a try to undergo a 5-day course of antibiotics (Keflex).Today is my third day of antibiotic treatment, symptoms are largely the same. Today, I attempted to hold my bladder. It felt fine in the morning but as the day went on, my symptoms returned and I am finding it harder to hold my bladder. Also, for the first time, I tried going for a run. The entire time I felt a heaviness in my bladder and felt a strong urge to urinate, even though I went before my run began. What do you think could be going on? My doctor believes that it is either a UTI, or most likely, a hypersensitive bladder due to exam stress. However, there have been days where I have not felt stress at all yet symptoms have continued. I am really worried as I want to go back to work in five days and I do not think I will be able to manage the way things are at the moment. My family doctor does think this will settle down now that I have finished exams. Do you think there is a chance it could? I have mentioned this query to another doctor online, and he believed it may be due to an overactive bladder. However, since I am relatively young to receive this diagnosis, I wanted a second opinion, if that is alright. Do you think this could be OAB? I am worried that it could be something serious, like multiple sclerosis. One and a half years ago, I had an episode of sudden onset numbness in one arm and fearing the same thing, I ended up having an MRI of my brain and lumbar spine which both came back negative.

Do you think this could be MS?\n\n### Response:It is likely that you are suffering from a urinary tract infection (UTI) or an overactive bladder. The increased urgency and frequency to urinate, along with the small amounts of urine, are common symptoms of a UTI. Additionally, the increased urgency and frequency, as well as the feeling of heaviness in the bladder during physical activity, are also common symptoms of an overactive bladder. The dipstick test and urine culture are helpful in diagnosing a UTI, and the white blood cell count on the dipstick and voiding bladder US suggests that you may have a UTI. It is also possible that you have an overactive bladder, especially since you are relatively young. It is important to finish the 5-day course of antibiotics and to monitor your symptoms. If the symptoms persist or worsen, it is best to consult a urologist for further evaluation and treatment. Additionally, it is unlikely that your symptoms are related to multiple sclerosis, as your MRI scan came back negative. It is possible that the stress of your exams has caused your symptoms, however, it is best to consult a doctor to be sure.",

The vibrating sensation you feel is likely due to the worms moving around in your anal area. Taking probiotics may have reduced the frequency of the vibrations, but it is still likely that you have an infestation. The half to one-inch white worms that you saw are likely pinworms. The itching of your anus may be due to an allergic reaction to the worms or their eggs.\n\nTaking Reese's Pinworm medicine should have killed the worms, however it is possible that some may still remain. Drinking apple cider vinegar and consuming garlic and carrots may create an uninviting environment for the worms and make it easier for them to be passed out of the body. It is also possible that you may see them in various places, however it is unlikely that they will be alive.\n\nThe pinworms should go away within a few days of taking the medicine, however it is possible that some may take longer. It is important to finish the entire course of medicine to ensure that all of the worms are killed.\n\nIt is also important to practice good hygiene to prevent the spread of pinworms.

I call his office and the office manager said that she would ask him about it.

I suffered minor but disruptive withdrawal symptoms physically and mentally for about two weeks and then they subsided but panic attacks continued to occur at random every day and my GAD symptoms increased to the point where CBT methods were not working.Then last month, the script was back to 4 mg per day normal dosage. I thought yes, back to normal. But again this month the script was back down to 3 mg per day which means I am going to experience a minor hell again.I am a defense and aerospace engineer who works on a contract basis through an agency and the client had noticed a drop in my performance before month but back to normal last month, now they are going to see it again and I will probably lose the contract job.

I suffered minor but disruptive withdrawal symptoms physically and mentally for about two weeks and then they subsided but panic attacks continued to occur at random every day and my GAD symptoms increased to the point where CBT methods were not working.Then last month, the script was back to 4 mg per day normal dosage. I thought yes, back to normal. But again this month the script was back down to 3 mg per day which means I am going to experience a minor hell again.I am a defense and aerospace engineer who works on a contract basis through an agency and the client had noticed a drop in my performance before month but back to normal last month, now they are going to see it again and I will probably lose the contract job. I also started online system engineer classes and I am freaking out over being able to handle the exams and homework as I typically work on the class at night and am now without my evening dose. I again asked for an explanation and was not given any.My question is a 25% cut in dosage physically dangerous and I am well aware of the strong psychological addition issues, so will this settle down before my career and social life and general well being take a hit and I revert to hiding in my apartment with my dog and my employer and friends will give up on me.\n\n### Response:It is not advisable to take Xanax for a long period of time and it is important to consult with your doctor to evaluate the potential risks and benefits of the medication. Abruptly stopping Xanax can cause withdrawal symptoms, so it is important to gradually reduce the dosage under medical supervision. Your doctor should be able to provide you with the best advice on how to safely manage your medication.",

This exercise can be done by lying flat on your back with knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Tighten your abdominal muscles and use your abdominal muscles to lift your lower back off the floor. Hold for 2-3 seconds and then lower yourself back down. This exercise should be done slowly and carefully, and repeated 10-15 times in 3 sets. In addition to the exercise, your mother should also be doing stretching and mobility exercises for the hip and spine, as well as strengthening exercises for the core muscles. She should also be maintaining good posture throughout the day and avoiding positions that put extra strain on the waist joint.",

The pain is caused by the bone trying to heal itself. To help relieve the pain, you should reduce the activity that puts weight on the ankle and try anti-inflammatories or painkillers. If the pain does not subside, you may need to wear a cast or use crutches to keep the ankle immobilized for a few weeks. It is also important to strengthen the surrounding muscles to provide better support and stability to the ankle. Physiotherapy may help with this.",

The dull pain you are feeling is most likely due to inflammation of the veins in your penis and pelvic floor area. You should get it checked by a doctor as soon as possible and get the necessary treatment. In the meantime, you can apply an ice pack to the affected area for 15-20 minutes every 3-4 hours to reduce the swelling and pain. You can also take over-the-counter pain medications such as ibuprofen or paracetamol to help manage the discomfort.",

They can appear on the abdomen, breasts, hips, buttocks and thighs. They are usually caused by rapid weight gain or growth, or by hormonal changes, such as those that occur during pregnancy. To prevent stretch marks, it is recommended to keep the skin well hydrated by using moisturizers and creams, and to avoid rapid weight gain or growth. Additionally, eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly can help maintain a healthy body weight and reduce the risk of stretch marks.",

Adenoids can also cause growth delay, but it is difficult to say for sure without more information. On average, girls reach their full adult height by the age of 18, so there is still time for her to grow taller. You could consult a pediatric endocrinologist to look into this further and get professional advice.

The main treatment for Sjogren's syndrome is to target the symptoms. Dry eyes can be treated with artificial tears, eye drops, and sometimes punctual plugs. Dry mouth can be treated with saliva substitutes and frequent sipping of water. Photosensitivity can be treated with sunscreen and protective clothing.

It is good that your doctor has ruled out any problems with your ears and that the audiogram showed no hearing loss. Tinnitus can be caused by a number of different things, including ear infections, loud noise exposure, certain medications, and stress. It is possible that an underlying medical condition could be causing your tinnitus, so it is important to explore other potential causes. Your doctor may recommend additional tests, such as an MRI or CT scan, to rule out any underlying conditions. In addition, certain lifestyle changes and therapies can help to manage tinnitus symptoms. These may include avoiding loud noises, managing stress, and using sound therapy. We recommend speaking with your doctor to further discuss your symptoms and develop a treatment plan.",

It is possible that the remaining tissue could be producing hormones in small amounts, but it is unlikely to be enough to cause the symptoms you are experiencing. It is important to monitor your blood tests regularly, as changes in thyroid hormone levels can occur over time. It is also possible that the symptoms you are experiencing are unrelated to thyroid function, and may be due to other medical conditions.

OHSS is a risk with any IVF cycle, but this risk can be minimized with careful monitoring. As a working woman, you may be able to continue working during your IVF treatment, but it is best to speak with your doctor to determine the best course of action.

It could be due to a number of different conditions, including heart failure, coronary artery disease, or an irregular heart rhythm. The doctor being able to see the heart is fine could mean that the problem is mild or that there are no other issues present. Further testing or monitoring may be necessary to better assess the situation.",

My primary doctor thinks this is due to heavy menstrual bleeding. Therefore, he advised me to see the gynecologist. I never thought I had heavy periods. What is the actual definition of heavy menstrual bleeding? My period always last for seven 7 days and the first 2 or 3 days will be heavier with some clots. I have to get up during the night once to change the pad only in the first two nights. I usually use about 25 to 30 pads during my periods. Can this be considered as heavy bleeding?

In addition, I am not sexually active and I am still a virgin. I have never been to the gynecologist and really do not know what to expect. What kind of examination the doctor will perform? How should I prepare for the visit? Please visit.\n\n### Response:Heavy menstrual bleeding is generally defined as soaking through one or more sanitary pads or tampons every hour for several hours, requiring blood to be washed out of clothes or bedding, or lasting for more than seven days. Your period duration and pad usage sounds normal, however it is still advisable to consult a gynecologist to rule out any potential underlying causes. During your visit, the doctor will likely perform a physical examination, including a pelvic exam, and may also order laboratory tests such as a complete blood count and iron studies. It is best to prepare for the visit by writing down any questions you may have and making a list of your medical history and medications.",

Is there any natural ways too to make sure no sperm left inside?\n\n### Response:Using condoms is the best way to avoid pregnancy and STIs. If condoms cause you pain, you should consider using another form of contraception, such as a different brand or size of condom, or a different form of contraception such as a diaphragm or IUD. With correct use, these methods are highly effective at preventing pregnancy. If you do come into contact with your partner\u2019s genital fluids, you should wash with soap and water as soon as possible, and consider taking emergency contraception. If you do not use condoms, you should use another form of contraception to protect against pregnancy. If you do come inside your partner, the first step is to wash with soap and water as soon as possible. Withdrawal is not a reliable form of contraception, and there is a risk of pregnancy if you do not use condoms. To find a condom that fits well, it is best to try out different sizes and brands to find one that is comfortable. There are also natural methods such as the rhythm method, but these are not as reliable as other forms of contraception. Finally, it is important to be aware of any STIs that you or your partner may have, and to take necessary precautions.",

The local doctor's suggestion to take Niterest 0.5 mg tablet and Melatonin 0.3 mg without any combination may be helpful in treating your tinnitus and improving your sleep. However, it is recommended that you consult a specialist before starting any medication. \n\nWe recommend that you keep a record of when and how loud the tinnitus is, as this may help the specialist in determining the cause. Additionally, you should avoid exposure to loud noises and limit your use of headphones or earbuds to prevent further damage. \n\nWe"

It is best to consult an orthopedic specialist for further evaluation and treatment. In the meantime, you should rest, ice, and compress the area to reduce swelling, and elevate the ankle above heart level to reduce pain and inflammation. You should also avoid activities that put pressure on the ankle and consider wearing a support or brace to help stabilize the joint. You should also take over-the-counter pain medications, such as ibuprofen or Tylenol, to reduce pain and inflammation.",

I went to the dentist yesterday and he cleaned my mouth and gave me antibiotics (Penicillin V) and Ibuprofen 600. I have been taking the antibiotics for two days now and I do not feel an improvement. Is this normal? How long does it normally take until it starts getting better? Should I go back to my dentist tomorrow? I take Ibuprofen but it only lasts for two to three hours. I am also using Chlorhexamed forte.\n\n### Response:It is not uncommon for Pericoronitis to require a longer course of antibiotics and it is best to wait and see how you feel in a couple of days. If you do not feel any improvement, then it is best to go back to your dentist and get reassessed. It is also important to take the full course of antibiotics even if you feel better. As for the Ibuprofen, it is best to take it regularly and not wait for the pain to get bad. You can also try other pain relievers such as Tylenol or Acetaminophen. Lastly, it is important to continue using Chlorhexamed forte as directed by your dentist.",

I have a long time pain from sound intake and it has worsened into my face. Other sensory triggers the pain. It has become just way too much to handle. I sought advice from friends and groups and nurses, that have trigeminal neuralgia and they suggest Carbamazepine.I learned it lowers Lamictal. I contacted pharmacy that said many will test blood serum of Lamictal and then add Carbamazepine and adjust Lamictal to therapeutic levels.My doctor is a bit concerned. She is not a pain doctor or neurologist. I am waiting to see one. But my condition makes it hard to travel in a car. My doctor asked I seek advice. Do you agree that checking the serum and adjusting is fine to do, in order to take Carbamazepine?The second option is Oxcarbazepine. In your experience is it a good pain drug for TN and does it mess up Lamictal? I found a study that said it did not.I was thinking I could start it now while I wait on Lamictal levels. And see if it helps. Just really struggling. Pain cream not helping much in certain places. My old neurologist wanted me to lower Glutamate as much as I could and suggested Namenda at one point. I know many people are on two and three drugs. I hope to try injections for the pain soon. Do you have any suggestions?\n\n### Response:It is important to consult with a pain specialist or neurologist before making any changes to your medications, including adding Carbamazepine. Your doctor is right to be concerned, as combining Lamictal and Carbamazepine can affect the levels of both drugs in your system and may require adjustments to your dosages. Oxcarbazepine is also a viable option, but it is important to understand the potential risks and benefits of both drugs before making a decision. It is also important to consider other treatment options, such as injections, and to weigh the risks and benefits of each. Your doctor will be able to provide the best advice based on your medical history and current condition.",

Initially, she got eczema kind small red rashes for which we applied Corticosteroid and later we observed whitish patches developing on those spots. Initially, the GP thought it could be tinea versicolor and suspected it could also be vitiligo.He referred us to a skin specialist and initially, the skin specialist thought it could be hypopigmentation and after a month, in the next appointment, she thought it could be vitiligo and started with Tacrolimus and Corticosteroid cream.Even before we started applying this Tacrolimus, we saw some repigmentation in some areas but it was slow repigmentation. We were confused as is it vitiligo or not and also as we are applying strong creams for a 6-year-old girl. Any long-term issues?We want to have a second opinion. I live in a city where it is very difficult to get skin specialist appointments. They give for every three to six months. Could you please help us in diagnosing the skin patches and treatment? I can send in the photos. I uploaded the photos:They all are on one side of the body (right side).On the hand, it started four months ago with a small white patch and gradually increased to the size and then we are seeing some repigmentation slowly very slowly to normal skin color.On the chest also, it started around the same time this year and not increased and stable.On the neck, it started early last month and it is not that whitish (like little less brownish).As said, the doctors diagnosed differently (postinflammatory hypopigmentation, tinea versicolor and finally vitiligo) so far and we are confused.

Based on the description and photos provided, it appears that your daughter may be suffering from vitiligo. Vitiligo is a condition that causes loss of skin color in patches due to destruction of the melanocytes (cells that produce skin color). The destruction of melanocytes can be caused by autoimmune, genetic, or other factors. It is possible that the corticosteroid cream may have caused a temporary depigmentation of the skin, which then led to a diagnosis of vitiligo. The repigmentation that you have seen could be due to the vitiligo or the corticosteroid cream. It is difficult to say without further examination. It is important to note that vitiligo is a chronic condition and treatment is usually aimed at repigmenting the skin or restoring skin color. This can include topical or oral medications, light therapy, or in some cases, surgery. It is best to consult with a dermatologist for further evaluation and treatment.",

The symptoms you are experiencing, such as pulsation in your buttocks and legs, dizziness, and increased sensitivity to food with high protein content, are consistent with this diagnosis. It is also likely that the detox and vitamin C supplements you were taking may have caused kidney irritation, which could explain the pain you experienced. \nToxicity from protein powder can usually be treated by reducing the intake of protein and increasing the intake of carbohydrates and fats. It is also important to drink plenty of fluids to help flush out the excess protein. Additionally, you may need to take medications to reduce inflammation and pain. \nIf you are concerned about potential long-term effects from the protein toxicity, it is best to consult a doctor or a toxicologist for further advice and treatment.",

It is important to remember that every pregnancy is different, and the hCG levels alone do not necessarily indicate a miscarriage. The most important factor is the ultrasound, and as long as the fetus is measuring appropriately for the gestational age and the heart rate is within the normal range, this is a good indication that the pregnancy is proceeding normally. It is understandable to be worried, but try to remain optimistic and focus on taking good care of yourself and attending any further appointments and scans.",

It is understandable that you are feeling embarrassed about your situation, but it is important to remember that you are not alone and help is available. \n\nYour symptoms suggest that you may have a condition known as anal fissures, which is a tear in the lining of the anal canal. This can be caused by constipation, hard stools, or anal sex. Other symptoms can include pain, swelling, and bleeding. \n\nThe first step to treating anal fissures is to reduce constipation and hard stools by increasing fiber and fluids in your diet. You should also avoid using laxatives or enemas. Applying a topical cream such as lidocaine or a steroid may help reduce inflammation, pain, and itching. In some cases, botox injections may be recommended. \n\nIf your symptoms are more severe or if conservative treatments do not work, you may need to consider other options. These can include sphincterotomy, which is a surgical procedure to cut the anal sphincter muscle, or lateral internal sphincterotomy, which is a less invasive surgical procedure. \n\nIt is important to note that anal fissures can be caused by anal sex, and it is important to practice safe sex by using protection such as",

Additionally, if you are still confused or unsure, it is always recommended to get a second opinion from a different doctor.",

There were other endocrine-related findings as well. In the course of various endocrine-related treatments and corresponding blood work, I began iron supplementation in the form of ferrous sulfate 143 mg daily. I began this before the blood work was done. So, you can see that that the levels have increased. Subsequent testing, a month later, showed a decline despite continuing treatment. Most recently, you can see that the levels are back up.

Please help me to understand iron\\s role, if any, in fatigue in the absence of anemia. And help me to then understand the rationale for treatment or lack thereof.

Low iron levels can certainly cause fatigue, and it is good that you are supplementing with iron to increase your levels. The conflicting advice you have received may be due to the fact that iron toxicity can be a concern if levels get too high. It is generally recommended to check iron levels every few months to ensure they are within the optimal range, and to stop supplementation if levels become too high. In terms of when iron toxicity occurs, this can vary from person to person and it is best to follow your doctor's advice on this. It is also important to keep in mind that fatigue can be caused by many different factors, and it is important to get tested for other potential causes.",

If the sore does not improve, it is best to consult a doctor or an ear nose and throat specialist (ENT) for further evaluation and treatment. They may prescribe a more suitable ointment or suggest other methods of treatment. It is also possible that you may have an infection, in which case antibiotics may be prescribed. It is best to get it checked as soon as possible. Hope this helps.",

As I recall she was on the top and then later I was on top of her. During the act, my condom slipped, but there was no exposure to my bare penis. I could not achieve an erection, so she removed the condom and applied lotion on my penis. My question is,1. Can her vaginal fluids enter my exposed penis as she applied lotion, making me infective (unknown status)?2. I had two p24 tests done at four and nine weeks. Both came negative. Should I go to 12 weeks or is this conclusive? Is there any chance of turning negative to positive?3. I feel swollen lymph node in my neck which occurred close to 12 weeks now. Am I HIV infective? Please help with your reply, and I am getting stressed.\n\n### Response:1. No, her vaginal fluids could not enter your exposed penis as she applied lotion, making you infective (unknown status). \n2.

This condition is caused by repetitive strain or a sudden injury to the tendons that attach to the outside of the elbow. It is possible that the Ultrasound did not detect any issues because this condition can also be caused by inflammation and microtears in the tendons, rather than a structural problem. \n\nI recommend that you continue with the Ibuprofen and Voltarin Samuel gel for a few more weeks and also try physical therapy. Physical therapists are trained to provide treatments such as stretching, strengthening, and modalities such as ultrasound and electrical stimulation that can help reduce inflammation and promote healing. If the pain persists after several weeks of conservative treatment, then surgical intervention may be an option.",

The problem is that I have developed extreme sensitivity to most of the drugs, medication, treatment. In the past, there were many instances of adverse reactions by taking medicines of Iron composition. These include restlessness, breathing problem, and diarrhea. About five years ago, upon the doctor's advice and supervision, I was fed intravenously through saline bottle with some Iron injection to it.

Please help me.\n\n### Response:Given your history of adverse reactions to iron treatments in the past, it is understandable to be worried about undergoing them again. There are a few alternatives that could be considered. Firstly, your doctor could try prescribing oral iron supplements instead of injections. This may be better tolerated and allow you to build up your iron levels gradually. Secondly, your doctor could test for possible food allergies and eliminate those from your diet. This could help improve your nutritional status and thus reduce the need for iron supplementation. Lastly, depending on the severity of your anemia, your doctor may recommend blood transfusions as a treatment option. This would involve donated blood being transfused into your system, thus increasing your iron levels without the need for supplements. All of these options should be discussed with your doctor so that the best course of action can be determined.",

Your due date is estimated to be nine weeks and three days from your last menstrual period. The CRL measurement of 26.96 is consistent with the gestational age of nine weeks and three days. There are typically 28-30 days between periods, but this can vary from woman to woman. As for the number of \"safe\" days after a period, it is generally advised to wait at least seven days after the end of your period before having intercourse. This helps to prevent any potential risk of pregnancy.",

My doctors are clueless and I am desperate. I hope you may have some suggestions.Symptoms:Persistent unbearable fatigue which is worst in the morning and afternoon, worsens after eating a meal, after standing up and after drinking coffee. It gets better after lying down with legs raised and after stretching the neck and after drinking alcohol. Otherwise the fatigue prevents me from doing most normal daily activities. I can barely sit and watch videos, eat and use the toilet. I am not able to do any other work. While sitting I fall asleep during the daytime.Resting and intention tremor (while rotating the wrists).Sluggish memory, fairly frequent memory lapses (forgetting my friends names). Clumsiness - when pressing buttons on the computer or microwave I often miss the button and while opening drawers or doors I grasp air instead of the handle, etc.Eye coordination problems - while reading my eyes jump over words thereby making me misread words for something else or just omit words.Cognitive difficulty - with mental arithmetics and planning and I often mispronounce words or use different words than the appropriate one in a sentence during speech.Post-void urinary dribbling and frequent defecation.Flashes of past memory like dreams while awake, euphoria turning into nausea and extreme tiredness afterwards.Pain in the neck, muscle cramps and stiffness in the neck and TMJ area. (I have had orthodontic treatment for the past 2.5 years for correcting underbite). Slightly dislocated coccyx.Pain and pressure behind the eyes, urge to blink often.Tests done and reports:MRI scan of the brain: normal.Thyroid function tests, Liver Function Tests (LFT), serum electrolytes, vitamin B12, kidney function tests: normal.Glucose blood test: normal.Lyme disease: no abnormalities.Gluten intolerance: no abnormalities.Complete Blood Count: no abnormalities.Urine microscopy: no abnormalities.Psychiatrist: no abnormalities, except worry about my health.No hypotension or orthostatic hypotension.Sleep study: no hypoxia or sleep apnea.No papilledema and nystagmus.Plantar reflex - flexion, negative Romberg\\s sign.Symmetrical reflexes.No family history of any disease, no childhood history, no epilepsy, no drugs ever taken.Serum C-reactive protein level, serum vitamin B12, serum ACE level, serum folate, complement C3, complement C4, ESR (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate) are within normal range.Could all of these be caused by anxiety disorder/ depression?What all tests would you recommend to rule out all possible underlying neurological conditions?

I recommend that you undergo the following tests: an MRI scan of the brain and spine, a lumbar puncture to check for underlying infections or inflammations, an EEG to rule out potential seizure disorders, and a neuropsychological evaluation to assess for cognitive deficits. Based on your symptoms, it is possible that you may be suffering from a neurological condition such as multiple sclerosis, lupus, or a autoimmune disorder. It is also possible that your symptoms may be related to depression and anxiety, and it is important to get a proper diagnosis so that you can receive the appropriate treatment.",

It is important to consult a doctor to determine the cause and receive appropriate treatment.",

The problem I have is that I have to try quite hard to speak in a normal tone, and I am extremely self-conscious about the way I sound.

It is also possible that the change in your voice is due to a combination of physical changes and increased self-consciousness about your voice, which could be affecting how you use your vocal cords.

I have been jumping from one idea to another for a long time but it has been three years I have an issue with frequent urination. It started in a bad time for me when I was obsessing that I have HIV. No burning, just slight urethra burning. I went to a urologist. He told me nothing was wrong, maybe an overactive bladder. I go to the toilet every two hours or three. I never knew what was wrong, but I started to obsess over it and it got worse to a place that my mind is in urination 24/7. I almost gave up until I went on a vacation and during that vacation, I forgot about it totally. The frequency was gone and even the burning urethra. Also, I had to remove my wisdom teeth and when I did, I was so occupied thinking about it that I forgot about urination and I noticed that I do not use the bathroom like I used to.

Can anxiety cause polyuria like this clear urine when I am stressed?\n\n### Response:It is possible for anxiety to cause polyuria, or frequent urination. The anxiety can cause the body to produce excessive amounts of cortisol, which can lead to an increase in urine production. This can lead to a feeling of urinary urgency, and cause you to need to urinate more frequently. It is also possible that your anxiety is causing you to obsess over your need to urinate, which can lead to a cycle of increased frequency. It is important to manage your anxiety in order to reduce the frequency of urination. This can be done through relaxation techniques, mindfulness, or cognitive-behavioral therapy. Medications may also be helpful. It is also important to rule out any potential medical causes for your symptoms, such as an overactive bladder or an infection. Your doctor can help you with this.",

Summer has started where I live, and I am addicted to playing cricket, whatever the weather or climate be. From last two weeks, I have noticed that my face color has become darker due to the sun. So, I am a little confused about which sunblock cream to use. I need your suggestion on which cream to use. I do not understand the concept of SPF 25, 30, 50 and 60.\n\n### Response:It is great that you are aware of the importance of sun protection and are looking for a sunblock cream. The Sun Protection Factor (SPF) of a sunblock cream indicates its level of effectiveness in protecting the skin from the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays. Generally, it is recommended to use a sunblock cream with an SPF of 30 or higher. You should also look for a cream that provides broad-spectrum protection, which means it can protect against both UVA and UVB rays. \n\nAs for which cream to use, it is best to consult a dermatologist, who can suggest a product based on your skin type and any allergies you may have. The dermatologist can also advise you on the appropriate amount and frequency of sunblock application.",

Based on your description, it is possible that you may have a blood clotting disorder or an underlying inflammatory condition such as lupus. It is important to follow up with your doctor to further investigate the cause of your elevated protein level and to monitor any changes in your platelet count. Your doctor may also recommend additional tests such as a complete blood count (CBC), blood chemistry panel, and/or a coagulation study to help rule out potential causes. It is also important to keep track of any new symptoms and to inform your doctor of any changes in your overall health.",

The most commonly known emergency contraceptive pill is I-pill. It contains a higher dose of the same hormones as regular contraceptive pills and works by preventing or delaying ovulation, thickening cervical mucus and blocking sperm from joining the egg.

These ingredients help to moisturize the skin and reduce tan.\n\nFinally, facials can help to reduce wrinkles and improve the overall health of your skin.

These ingredients help to reduce wrinkles, brighten the skin, and increase hydration.\n\nI hope this helps!",

While in hospital, she contracted C.diff and has had several recurring bouts with it. She has had a transplant and so far she is doing well with no recurrence. She also has a fistula near the rectum from an abscess. They put in a tube to keep it open and flowing. She has always had bouts of constipation and diarrhea for years before the accident. Her cognitive functions have been diminishing. One of my brothers is living with her and care taking her for full time.She is very weak, but can walk with the aid of a walker. Before the accident, she was fine. But, she may have shown a few signs of slight memory issues and balance prior to the accident as well. Our main issue right now is loose stools with some fecal incontinence. The doctor said that the fecal incontinence is because of a weak rectum that will not hold back fecal matter. Also, the fistula is always draining. When her stools are normal, she has good energy and cognitive function. When she has loose stools, she is very weak and can hardly stand or walk. Her cognitive function is a lot worse. She gets very confused about daily items and memory issues.We are looking for supplements to keep her regular and avoid the loose stool episodes. These are recurring every other week. Being so weak at the time of an episode, the toilet and the surrounding area get very filthy. She has little control and not able to clean herself properly. Her diet is pretty good. We are trying to keep dairy items away, limiting sugar and some carbohydrates as best as we can.We are giving her Metamucil when she has loose stools as well as some ammonium. This seems to have very limited success. She is on a blood pressure medicine as well as on Coumadin. So, we have to watch for interactions between everything. Regarding supplements, right now she is taking Alpha-GPC, Prevagen and multivitamins B for cognitive help, Fish oil, turmeric and Centrum multivitamins.Any help or suggestions to prevent the loose stools without creating constipation would be appreciated. I would also like to increase her core energy, so she will feel more like moving around. We have a physical therapist at once a week.",

It is important to finish the entire course of antibiotics as prescribed, even after you start to feel better, to ensure that the infection is fully cleared.

If you do not start to feel better after taking the antibiotics for three days, or if the diarrhea gets worse, you should consult your doctor again.",

This is a natural part of the aging process and cannot be reversed with non-invasive techniques. Retinol-A may help improve the appearance of your skin, but it will not completely reverse the effects of aging. Vitamin C and E serums, as well as facials and massages, may help improve the overall appearance of your skin, but they will not correct the depression you have developed. Facial exercises may help to a certain extent, but they will not completely restore your facial contours. Losing weight may help improve the appearance of your face, but it will not completely prevent your skin from becoming loose. To help reduce the looseness of your skin, you should focus on exercises that target the muscles underneath your facial skin. Additionally, you should look into procedures such as facelifts, neck lifts, and eyelid lifts, which can help restore your facial contours and reduce the looseness of your skin.",

He says since I still have symptoms, that I have testosterone resistance. His analogy was; like diabetics, their bodies produce insulin but just does not know what to do with it.So, his treatment recommendation is TRT testosterone replacement therapy along with Clomid. I am hesitant because I feel this therapy is overused nowadays, and I feel pretty good except my libido.Sought a second opinion today from my urologist, he seemed disinterested in me doing that but said if I try a few injections it would not hurt me, then advised me to run this by an endocrinologist.So I guess in summary:Do you believe that testosterone resistance is a valid diagnosis?If I do try the TRT, can I stop after a few weeks or a few injections and get back to the way I am right now with no permanent issues?Should I just start the Clomid again, or just keep using the Cialis and keep working out and trying to clean up my diet more?Any other thoughts and advise would be appreciated.

It is likely that the Venlafaxine XR was more effective than the SSRIs because it works on both serotonin and noradrenaline, whereas the SSRIs only target serotonin. It is also possible that the Lamictal is helping to boost the effects of the Venlafaxine XR. It is important to give the current medication time to work before increasing the dose, as this can help to ensure that the medication has the best chance of providing optimal relief with the fewest side effects. If after two weeks on the current doses of Venlafaxine XR and Lamictal you are still lacking energy and motivation, then it may be beneficial to increase the Venlafaxine XR to 150 mg. It is also possible that adding another medication may provide additional benefits. You could discuss this option with your prescribing doctor.",

I took two painkillers and managed to sit there for a while, but after two to three hours the pain started radiating to leg. I was diagnosed with moderate disc herniation at L4-L5 and L5-S1. I was advised to take bed rest for three months and felt better after five months. Then I got some manipulation done with my lower back and my condition got worse. After that I had slight pain in my tail bone while walking and the pain got worse when I sit for five minutes. It got radiated to hips, thighs and it was worse when I stood up from a sitting position. Then I left with no option except bed rest for another four months that is a total nine months of bed rest. After that I suddenly started walking two to three hours a day in a stretch and started doing some exercises. After few days of getting my body too much into motion I felt my upper back getting stuck and again was unable to move and the pain radiated to my wrist and hand. Then had bed rest for another 10 days and felt a bit better. But, still in pain and resumed with two to three hours of brisk walking and exercises. I noticed that many joints in my body were making cracking sound while I walk or move my body and they were continuous. They are not going away no matter how much I move that joint, the cracking sound will repeat infinite times whenever I move my body. The cracking sound is mostly from lower and upper back, shoulder, ankle, foot fingers, knees also make that cracking sound and it is painful as well. Cracking sound in knees are felt more when I start walking after being in rest state and frequency of cracking sound reduces after walking for two to three minutes.I got my ESR and CRP checked. They are normal, but there is a slight increase in lymphocytes and RBC. Now, I have been suffering from this continuous cracking sounds and pain in almost all my joints for more than a month now. I also suffer from severe pain in tail bone area. Also suffers from some sensation loss (not persistent) in left side of my upper left leg, pain in groin area (but not anymore), pain in lower back and upper back.

Right now, I am taking only Vitamin D3 supplement. I am attaching all my reports for your reference.\n\n### Response:Given the severity of your symptoms and the length of time that you have been experiencing them, it is likely that you have a more serious condition than a simple disc herniation. It is possible that you have a spinal cord compression or nerve root compression, which would explain the radiating pain, sensation loss, and joint cracking sounds. It is also possible that you have developed an autoimmune condition, which could be causing the increased lymphocytes and RBC count in your bloodwork. It is important to get further evaluation and possible imaging studies to determine the cause of your symptoms. Your doctor may also want to check thyroid function, vitamin levels, and perform a neurological exam. It is also important to get appropriate treatment, which may include physical therapy, pain management, and/or surgery.",

However, an OCT showed nerve fiber thinning and ganglion cell thinning.\n\n### Response:Based on the patient's description, it is likely that they have angle-closure glaucoma. The decreased vision in the right eye and the subsequent worsening of the left eye indicates a possible blockage of the drainage angle in the eye, which can lead to an increase in intraocular pressure and resulting vision loss if left untreated. The OCT findings of nerve fiber and ganglion cell thinning further supports this diagnosis. A thorough ophthalmological evaluation including gonioscopy, which looks directly at the drainage angle of the eye, should be done to confirm the diagnosis and initiate appropriate treatment.",

UTI is a common infection that can affect any part of the urinary tract, including the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. The burning sensation during urination and the slight pain in the penis are common symptoms of UTI. The abnormalities seen in the urine routine test and the positive urine culture report indicates that the infection is caused by bacteria.

It is important to complete the full course of antibiotics as prescribed by the doctor and to follow up with the urologist to ensure that the infection has been completely resolved. Additionally, it is important to practice good hygiene, drink plenty of fluids, and empty the bladder frequently to help prevent UTIs from recurring.",

She refused to do that, I am not sure if it is because she did not want to change her opinion or it is because she did not want to satisfy my compulsion. My mother was encouraging me to do these kinds of compulsions as she thought it is going to get worse. It was a bad thing as she was validating my fears in this way. I just realized these things now so I started to confront my fears about what the psychiatrist said to me. But I ran into another one which is about what if my mother is right and if I am confronting my fears it is going to get worse. What do you think?",

I am having OCD since I was 12 years old. I have a strong fear of an event that happened a couple of years ago when a psychiatrist told me that I have a borderline disorder and have no fantasy. I was trying to ask her for years to say me the opposite as a compulsion. She refused to do that, I am not sure if it is because she did not want to change her opinion or it is because she did not want to satisfy my compulsion.

But I ran into another one which is about what if my mother is right and if I am confronting my fears it is going to get worse. What do you think?\n\n### Response:It is great that you are taking steps to confront your fears, as this is the most effective way to manage OCD. It is understandable that you are worried about what might happen if you continue to confront your fears, but it is important to remember that the consequences of not confronting your fears are often much worse. It is also possible that your mother was not entirely correct in validating your fears, and it is important to remember that she was not a professional and may not have had the full picture. It is best to take professional advice on board when it comes to managing mental health issues. I would recommend continuing to confront your fears in a gradual and controlled manner, and to seek professional help if necessary.",

Doctor did not mention anything other than lbbb that was previously diagnosed.\n\n### Response:It is true that chemical or nuclear stress echocardiograms are more accurate than a regular stress echocardiogram in patients with left bundle branch block. This is because the electrical signal that is sent to the heart to make it contract is not being transmitted properly with left bundle branch block, and so the walls of the heart may not be contracting in a synchronized manner. This can make it difficult to get an accurate assessment of the heart's function with a regular stress echocardiogram. It is important to get an accurate assessment of your heart function, especially with a family history of heart disease, so I would recommend getting a chemical or nuclear stress echocardiogram. In terms of exercise, it is still a great form of activity and can be beneficial for your overall health, but it may not be the best way to stress the heart for an accurate echocardiogram.\n\nAs for your medications, Spironolactone is used to treat acne and Omeprazole is used to reduce stomach acid. It is important to be aware that both of these medications can cause side effects, so it is important to discuss any concerns you may have with your doctor. Additionally, it is important to be aware that some medications can interact with each other, so it is important to make sure that all of your doctors are aware of all of the medications that you are",

The decision to proceed with a VBAC (vaginal birth after cesarean) is a personal one and should be discussed in detail with your doctor. \n\nAs for the risks of pregnancy in women over 40, these risks can include increased risk of gestational diabetes, high blood pressure, and miscarriage. There is also an increased risk of having a baby with certain genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome. Additionally, women over 40 are more likely to require a C-section and have a longer labor and delivery.",

        "input": "Hello doctor, For ten years, my husband has been successfully using an extended wear bandage contact lens (monthly wear) to control the pain of aphakic bullous keratopathy in one eye. About seven months ago, he had an episode of foreign body pain in the eye which the contact lens could not control. His optometrist changed the type of lens after remarking that the lens appeared tight. Although the painful sensations have decreased, they are still present with more of a sore feeling now. His ophthalmologist suggested that he discontinue the Azopt drops he had been using in case the preservative was causing some corneal toxicity. His eye pressure without the drops has read at 18 and 20 on separate occasions, but he does have corneal edema which may affect the measurement. He has had high pressure in that eye previously, but it was mostly lowered by Cyclodiode treatment some eight years ago. The consultant said he had left him on the Azopt drops just as a precaution. My query is that if the bandage lens has worked so well for pain management for 10 years is it possible that it can continue to work? And if the Azopt drops and their preservative had caused some toxic reaction seven months ago, could that still be causing him to feel the discomfort? His consultant suggested out that he could have the eye removed to control the pain, but as he has what he feels is some slight, useful vision in that eye, he does not want to take such a drastic and life-changing step. In fact, he wants to pursue the least invasive course of action to relieve the pain he is getting. I would appreciate any advice you could give as he is in quite a bit of pain.",

Your X-ray coming back clear indicates that the issue is not being caused by any underlying lung conditions.

Should I get additional examination?\n\n### Response:Yes, it is recommended that you get additional examination. Transillumination is a test used to detect certain disorders of the testicles, so it is better to be safe and have it checked out. Your doctor will likely perform a physical examination and may order additional tests such as an ultrasound. It is best to consult with a doctor to determine the best course of action.",

Without an X-ray it is difficult to say for sure, but it is likely that both elbows are broken since you are aware of the X-ray results. The lack of pain when not stretching the elbow could be a sign of swelling and bruising, which can mask the pain of a fracture. It is better to be safe and get the cast to ensure proper healing.",

I honestly do not understand the benefits of a ketone diet, what are they? Is a ketone diet good for those who are diabetic?\n\n### Response:A ketone diet is a high-fat, low-carb diet that can offer many health benefits. It is particularly beneficial for those who are looking to lose weight, reduce their risk of heart disease, and improve their overall health. For those with diabetes, a ketone diet can help regulate blood sugar levels and promote better overall health. The diet is focused on eating foods high in healthy fats, such as nuts, seeds, avocados, and oils, while limiting carbohydrates. This shift in diet can help the body burn fat instead of carbs, producing ketones which can be used for energy.",

While both drugs target the norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, they have different mechanisms of action. Therefore, it is generally considered safe to take the two medications in combination, provided that your psychiatrist has monitored and approved of the dosage. As with any medication, there is a risk of side effects and interactions, so it is important to be mindful of that and to follow your psychiatrist's instructions closely.",
