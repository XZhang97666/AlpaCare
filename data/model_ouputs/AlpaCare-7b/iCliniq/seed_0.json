Now my question is, is there any chance that the infection is still in my body? And, do I need to get examined for it? For the time being, please suggest some precautionary antibiotics for my relief.\n\n### Response:Based on the description you provided, it seems like you are experiencing post-mumps orchitis, which is an infection of the testicles following mumps. The swelling and shrinkage of the testicle are common symptoms of this condition.\n\nRegarding the infection still being present in your body, it is possible that the infection has not been completely cleared. In some cases, mumps orchitis can lead to chronic epididymitis, which is characterized by recurrent episodes of inflammation in the epididymis (the tube that carries sperm from the testicle).\n\nTo determine if the infection is still present, I would recommend seeking medical attention from a healthcare professional, such as a urologist or infectious disease specialist. They will be able to evaluate your symptoms, perform any necessary tests (such as a physical examination, blood tests, or cultures), and provide appropriate treatment if needed.\n\nIn the meantime, to alleviate your symptoms and provide relief, you can consider taking antibiotics as prescribed by your healthcare provider. However, it is important to note that antibiotics alone may not be sufficient to treat the underlying cause of the infection.\n\nPlease consult with a healthcare professional for further evaluation and guidance.",

It's important to understand that using cocaine during pregnancy can have harmful effects on both the mother and the developing fetus.\n\nThe answer to your first question is that you should wait for at least three months after using cocaine before trying to conceive. This is because it takes approximately three months for the majority of cocaine to be eliminated from the body.\n\nRegarding the duration of cocaine in sperm, it is estimated that cocaine can remain present in semen for up to 48 hours after use. However, it's important to note that the concentration of cocaine in semen may decrease over time.\n\nI would strongly recommend seeking counseling and support from a healthcare professional or a reproductive specialist who can provide personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances.

I am now very worried what good precautions should I take with him. Can you suggest me what should I do?\n\n### Response:As a doctor, I would recommend the following precautions for your son with myopia (nearsightedness):\n\n1. Encourage regular eye exams: It is important to have his eyes examined by an optometrist or an ophthalmologist at least once a year, or more frequently if there are any concerns or changes in his vision.\n\n2. Ensure proper lighting: Make sure the lighting in his bedroom and other areas he spends time in is adequate and not too bright or dim. This can help reduce eyestrain and strain on the eyes.\n\n3. Limit screen time: Encourage him to take regular breaks from close-up activities such as watching TV, playing video games, or using electronic devices. This can help prevent excessive eye strain and promote eye health.\n\n4. Wear protective eyewear: When participating in activities that involve potential eye injuries, such as sports or hobbies like woodworking, ensure he wears appropriate protective eyewear to safeguard his eyes.\n\n5. Maintain good posture: Teach him proper posture and ergonomics to minimize strain on his eyes and body. This includes sitting up straight, maintaining a neutral spine, and avoiding excessive bending or tilting of the head.\n\n6. Promote out",

The presence of a gestation sac with no fetal or yolk sac on the USG report suggests a possible miscarriage or early pregnancy loss.\n\nThe symptoms you are currently experiencing, such as lower abdominal pain, bleeding, and relief of pain when lying down, are consistent with a condition called \"decidual bleeding.\" Decidual bleeding occurs when the lining of the uterus (decidua) breaks down and sheds blood. This can happen as a result of a miscarriage or as a natural process during the early stages of pregnancy.\n\nI would recommend contacting your healthcare provider immediately to discuss your symptoms and any concerns you may have. They will be able to provide further guidance and determine the appropriate course of action based on your specific situation. It is important not to delay in seeking medical attention in order to ensure proper evaluation and management.",

My doctors keep telling me that we will just watch my ferritin level and I have bloodwork done every six months. I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia last year. I am looking for some answers and some help.\n\n### Response:Based on the information provided, it seems that you have a chronically elevated ferritin level. Ferritin is a protein that stores iron in the body, and high levels can indicate iron overload conditions such as hemochromatosis. However, since your TIBC (total iron-binding capacity), UIBC (unbound iron-binding capacity), iron, and iron saturation levels are all within normal range, it suggests that your elevated ferritin level may not be due to hemochromatosis.\n\nGiven that your doctors have already ruled out hemochromatosis, it is important to consider other potential causes for your elevated ferritin level. One possibility is that your chronically elevated ferritin level could be related to another condition, such as inflammation or certain medications.\n\nTo further investigate the cause of your elevated ferritin level, I would recommend discussing your symptoms and test results with a rheumatologist or a specialist in iron disorders. They can provide a more comprehensive evaluation and consider additional diagnostic tests if necessary.\n\nIn the meantime, it is important to monitor your symptoms closely and communicate any changes or new developments with your healthcare provider.

For the past 3 months, I have been experiencing this facial tightness which comes pretty often throughout the day with different intensity. The facial tension usually comes half an hour after I leave the bed. The tightness on my face happens to be on both sides of my face but usually more intense on the right. At times, I can feel it from my neck all the way up to my face. As of recent, I have been feeling this slight burning sensation on my chest to my shoulders as well. Prior to this facial tightness, I have been suffering from this burning feeling on the centre of my chest for about a month. It was my first time experiencing heartburn and I thought it was heart related. Went for X-rays and echo heart ultrasound. Everything came out fine. I have a healthy heart.

I did blood test. It came out normal. They told me I do not need to do any scans and that it was merely anxiety and it will go off by itself. I convinced myself that I had anxiety because of the one month heartburn ordeal that I was suffering from. Even though the facial tightness was there, I tried my utmost best to ignore it.

This has resulted in two major falls, which resulted in trauma. These are present for past few months and have become more frequent in the last month. She also has pain in her knees bilaterally, which has been attributed to osteoarthritis. She also complains of hip pain associated with swelling and difficulty in standing, lying and changing sides while sleeping. There is episodic stiffness present in the shoulders, which causes some discomfort in raising arms above the shoulder level. She is taking Bisoprolol 5 mg and Amlodipine 5 mg for high BP and it is well-controlled. She has no history of any allergy. She has kidney stones and so occasional pain in the lumbar area. She used to get constipation frequently. She was hospitalized four times for normal vaginal deliveries and once for abortion. She is monogamous with her husband. She has a positive family history of hypertension in mother, CAD in father, mother and brother and uterine cancer in mother.

Here are a few possibilities:\n\n1. Peripheral neuropathy: Episodic loss of weight-bearing ability on the left Achilles tendon could be indicative of peripheral neuropathy, which is a condition affecting the nerves that control movement and sensation in the extremities. This could be caused by various factors such as diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, or certain medications.\n\n2. Osteoarthritis: Pain in the knees bilaterally and difficulty in standing, lying, and changing sides while sleeping could be related to osteoarthritis, a degenerative joint disease. This condition commonly affects weight-bearing joints like the knees.\n\n3. Rheumatoid arthritis: Although less likely given the absence of joint swelling and morning stiffness, rheumatoid arthritis can also cause pain and stiffness in the knees. However, it typically affects multiple joints symmetrically.\n\n4. Gout: Episodic hip pain associated with swelling and difficulty in standing, lying, and changing sides while sleeping could be indicative of gout, a form of arthritis caused by the buildup",

He was with someone who now has heart palpitations, sweaty palms and feet, and lightheadedness sitting in the living room. We ran a battery of tests when it first happened including TSH, EKG, lung scans, blood panels, etc. and everything was normal. So we went down the path of anxiety. Four years later, the symptoms continued. As my son now has a terrible fear of doctors, we tried a home blood test to get a full thyroid panel. I have attached the results.The blood work came back normal. Low normal TSH, but low normal T4 and lower normal free T4 and free T3. There is nothing that shows an abnormality. However, his urine test showed moderately low iodine and slightly low selenium. I have read that abnormalities in these measures could cause thyroid problems. What am I wondering is if these two indicators are worth further exploration with an endocrinologist knowing that going to the doctor will cause my son a severe panic.Also, is it possible that low iodine could have been a temporary diet thing and it is masking the signs of hyperthyroidism in the blood work? He has all of the symptoms of someone with hyperthyroidism.

The symptoms came out of the blue and have persisted over time.\n\nThe initial battery of tests conducted to rule out any underlying medical conditions did not reveal any abnormalities in thyroid function. However, the recent blood work showed slightly low normal levels of T4 and free T4, indicating possible thyroid dysfunction.\n\nThe low normal TSH level suggests that the thyroid gland is producing enough thyroid hormones, but the levels of T4 and free T4 are still below the normal range. This pattern is consistent with primary hypothyroidism, where there is an issue with the thyroid gland itself rather than a problem with the pituitary gland or hypothalamus regulating thyroid function.\n\nThe presence of low iodine and slightly low selenium in the urine test may contribute to thyroid dysfunction. Iodine is necessary for the production of thyroid hormones, and selenium is involved in the conversion of T4 to T3, the active form of thyroid hormone.\n\nConsidering the family history of thyroid issues, it would be prudent to further investigate the possibility of thyroid dysfunction in your son. I recommend scheduling an appointment with an endocrinologist who specializes in thyroid",

This can lead to pain, swelling, infection, and difficulty in opening your mouth fully.\n\n2. Crowding: If the wisdom tooth is growing straight but there is insufficient space for it to erupt properly, it can cause crowding of the other teeth. This can result in discomfort, pain, and difficulty in chewing.\n\n3. Cyst or Abscess: In some cases, an impacted wisdom tooth can develop into a cyst or abscess, which is an infected sac-like structure filled with fluid or pus. This can cause severe pain, swelling, and potentially affect your overall oral health.\n\nTo determine the exact cause of your symptoms and provide appropriate treatment, it is important to visit a dentist or an oral surgeon.

Continue using the prescribed Otinex ear drops as directed by the doctor.\n2. Keep the affected ear(s) clean and dry. Avoid swimming or using hot tubs until the infection is completely cleared.\n3. Gently clean the outer ear with a cotton swab dipped in rubbing alcohol, being careful not to insert the swab too far into the ear canal.\n4. If the discharge becomes thick, yellowish, or smelly, it may indicate a bacterial infection. In such cases, it is advisable to consult a doctor for further evaluation and treatment.\n5. Avoid scratching or touching the affected ear to prevent introducing bacteria or further irritation.\n\nIf the symptoms persist or worsen after following these suggestions, it is recommended to consult a healthcare professional for further evaluation and guidance.",

Chronic urticaria can be quite uncomfortable and it's important to find the underlying cause. Based on your description, it seems like your symptoms are triggered by heat and exercise.\n\nThe blood test will help determine if there are any specific triggers or causes for your hives. It can provide information about your immune system, allergies, and other factors that may contribute to your symptoms.\n\nIn the meantime, it's worth trying a different medication for your hives. Cetirizine (Zyrtec) is an antihistamine that can help relieve symptoms of allergies, but it may not be effective for everyone. You could consider switching to a different antihistamine or discussing other treatment options with your doctor.\n\nIt's important to follow up with your doctor after the blood test to discuss the results and determine the best course of action for managing your hives. They will be able to prescribe the most appropriate medication based on your specific needs and the findings from the blood test.\n\nPlease keep us updated on your progress and let us know if you have any further questions.",

However, there are some non-surgical approaches that can be considered in certain cases. For example, in infants and young children, a watchful waiting approach may be taken if the hydrocele is small and not causing any symptoms. In some adults, if the hydrocele is small and not causing any problems, they may choose to monitor it closely rather than undergoing surgery immediately.\n\nRegarding your question about physical exercise, there should not be any problems with it. Engaging in regular exercise, including weightlifting, can actually have several benefits for your overall health and well-being.

I keep pushing it with my tongue and clenching a bit against it and I just noticed that it has become loose little more. I have my wisdom teeth and I think it might be applying pressure forward on these teeth. I read in a book that day grinding can cause a teeth to loosen, which is easier to treat. There is no pain and the teeth look healthy. I always clench my teeth but it never caused any looseness.\n\n### Response:Based on the patient's description, it is possible that the loosening of the first molar is due to clenching and grinding of teeth. Clenching and grinding can put excessive pressure on the teeth, leading to tooth looseness over time.\n\nHowever, since there is no pain and the teeth look healthy, it is important to monitor the situation closely. If the looseness continues or worsens, it would be advisable to consult a dentist for further evaluation and treatment options.\n\nIn the meantime, the patient can try to reduce the clenching and grinding habits to alleviate the pressure on the teeth. This may involve practicing relaxation techniques, using mouth guards during sleep, or seeking professional help from a dentist or orthodontist for guidance and treatment options.",

Will they fade with the time? Do we need to take any precautions so that they do not increase or get added further? Can we also provide any medication to cure them?\n\n### Response:Based on the description provided, the brown marks on the baby girl's skin are likely birthmarks. Birthmarks are typically present at birth or appear shortly afterward and can vary in size, shape, and color.\n\nMost birthmarks will fade over time as the child grows, although the rate of fading can vary. It is important to note that not all birthmarks will completely disappear, and some may remain permanent.\n\nIn terms of precautions, there is generally no need to take specific precautions to prevent the marks from increasing or spreading further. However, if the marks are causing distress or affecting the child's self-esteem, it may be helpful to consult with a dermatologist who can provide guidance on managing the appearance of the marks.\n\nAs for medication to cure the birthmarks, there are no specific medications available to treat or remove them. However, certain procedures such as laser therapy or cryotherapy (freezing) may be considered in certain cases, but this would depend on the specific characteristics of the birthmarks and the recommendation of a dermatologist.\n\nIt is recommended to monitor the marks closely and consult with a healthcare professional if there are any concerns or changes in appearance.",

Or is it the standard procedure to fight the infection first and then remove the nerves?\n\n### Response:As a medical expert, I can provide information on the standard procedure for a root canal. During a root canal, the dentist typically removes the infected or damaged pulp from the tooth, cleans the area, and then fills and seals it. However, the specific steps and duration of the procedure may vary depending on the individual case.\n\nIn some cases, the dentist may choose to remove the nerves before proceeding with the root canal if the tooth is severely infected or if there is significant pain associated with the nerves. This is known as a \"nerve-dead\" tooth. However, it is not a standard procedure to first insert medicine and then remove the nerves.\n\nIt is important to consult with your dentist regarding your specific situation.

The doctor initially prescribed Sterdex for you, which helped alleviate the pain. However, after a few months, the pain returned and was not as severe as before.\n\nGiven your symptoms, it is possible that you are experiencing a condition called blepharitis, which is inflammation of the eyelid margins.

Use warm compresses: Apply a warm compress to your closed eyes for a few minutes to help alleviate any discomfort and reduce inflammation.\n\n3.

Regular monitoring by a healthcare professional is essential during TRT to ensure safety and adjust treatment if needed.\n\nWhile testosterone injections can help in improving physical characteristics such as muscle mass and strength, they may not necessarily improve facial features or voice pitch.

Non-alcoholic mouthwashes often rely on other active ingredients like essential oils, herbs, or antibacterial agents to provide their therapeutic benefits.\n\nIn terms of combating bad breath from smoking, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic mouthwashes can be effective.

It typically presents as white patches or plaques on the tongue, inner cheeks, gums, or throat. The red border may be due to inflammation.\n\nThe white coating on the tongue that needs to be scraped off is actually the accumulation of dead fungal cells.

However, it is not uncommon for children to start walking at different ages. Some children may start walking as early as 9 months or as late as 15 months. If your son is within the normal range of walking milestones and continues to make progress with his mobility, there is likely no cause for concern. However, if you have any concerns about his development or if he is experiencing any pain or difficulty with crawling or walking, it would be best to consult with his pediatrician for further evaluation.",

Acne rosacea is a chronic skin condition characterized by redness, small red pimples, and inflammation. It commonly affects the face, particularly the cheeks, nose, forehead, and chin.\n\nTo help manage your acne rosacea, I would recommend the following steps:\n\n1. Avoid triggers: Identify and avoid any triggers that may worsen your symptoms, such as spicy foods, alcohol, hot beverages, sunlight, stress, and certain skincare products.\n\n2. Moisturize regularly: Use a gentle, fragrance-free moisturizer to keep your skin hydrated and help reduce inflammation.\n\n3. Use topical treatments: Over-the-counter creams containing ingredients like metronidazole, azelaic acid, or sulfur can help reduce inflammation and kill bacteria. These are available in different strengths and should be used as directed.\n\n4. Prescription medications: If over-the-counter treatments are not effective, your dermatologist may prescribe topical or oral antibiotics, isotretinoin (Accutane), or other medications specifically designed for treating acne rosacea",

Treatment for lower back muscle spasms may include:\n\n1. Physical therapy: A physical therapist can guide the patient through exercises to strengthen the muscles in the lower back and improve flexibility.\n2. Heat or cold therapy: Applying heat or cold packs to the affected area can help relieve pain and reduce muscle spasm.\n3. Medications: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or muscle relaxants may be prescribed to alleviate pain and reduce muscle spasm.\n4. Rest and activity modification: Avoiding activities that exacerbate the symptoms and incorporating regular rest periods can help in managing the condition.\n\nIt is important",

This condition is often caused by excessive oil production, irritation, or inflammation in the area.\n\nTo manage the current flare-up of perioral dermatitis, it is important to avoid further irritation from medications such as coconut oil and tea tree oil. Instead, gentle, non-fragranced soaps should be used for washing the face, and regular gentle cleansing with water alone may suffice. Avoiding excessive sun exposure and using sunscreen when necessary can also help prevent further irritation from the sun.\n\nIt would be best for the patient to consult with a healthcare professional, such as a dermatologist, who can provide a proper diagnosis and recommend appropriate treatment options tailored to their specific needs.",

However, it is important to note that these results are not normal for an 18-year-old male.\n\nLow HGH levels can affect growth and development, especially during puberty. In adulthood, low HGH levels can lead to symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, weight gain, and decreased muscle mass.\n\nLow testosterone levels can also have various effects on the body, including decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, fatigue, and muscle weakness.\n\nIt is possible that your short stature and defined leg muscles could be related to your low HGH and testosterone levels. However, other factors such as previous torsion (testicular twisting) and excessive mobile phone use could also contribute to these symptoms.\n\nTo further evaluate your condition, I recommend consulting with an endocrinologist or a specialist in male reproductive health. They will be able to conduct a thorough examination, review your medical history, and order additional tests if necessary.\n\nIn terms of increasing testosterone levels, there are several options available.

In adulthood, low HGH levels can lead to symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, weight gain, and decreased muscle mass.\n\nLow testosterone levels can also have various effects on the body, including decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, fatigue, and muscle weakness.\n\nIt is possible that your short stature and defined leg muscles could be related to your low HGH and testosterone levels. However, other factors such as previous torsion (testicular twisting) and excessive mobile phone use could also contribute to these symptoms.\n\nTo further evaluate your condition, I recommend consulting with an endocrinologist or a specialist in male reproductive health. They will be able to conduct a thorough examination, review your medical history, and order additional tests if necessary.\n\nIn terms of increasing testosterone levels, there are several options available. However, it is important to note that any medical intervention should be done under the guidance of a"

This can sometimes lead to the formation of a seroma. The liposuction may have also caused some inflammation and fluid accumulation in the area.\n\nIt is important to note that this is just a possible explanation for your symptoms.

Hormonal imbalance: Acne is often associated with hormonal changes, such as those that occur during puberty, pregnancy, or menstrual cycles.\n2. Excess oil production: Some individuals have naturally oily skin, which can lead to clogged pores and subsequent acne breakouts.\n3. Bacteria: Propionibacterium acnes, a type of bacteria, plays a role in the development of acne.\n\nTo address your concerns, I would recommend the following:\n\n1. Topical treatments: Benzoyl peroxide is a common ingredient in over-the-counter acne medications. It helps to reduce inflammation and kill bacteria. In addition to using it as a gel, you can also consider using spot treatments or washes containing benzoyl peroxide.\n2. Non-comedogenic products: When choosing skincare products, opt for non-comedogenic options. These products are less likely to clog pores and contribute to acne breakouts.\n3.

Acute hepatitis B is a short-term infection that typically resolves on its own within a few months without long-term complications. In contrast, chronic hepatitis B is a lifelong infection that can lead to liver damage if left untreated.\n\nThe HBsAg test detects the presence of the hepatitis B surface antigen, which is produced during the acute phase of the infection.

However, the swollen feet and hands could be a sign of an underlying inflammatory process.\n\nI recommend the patient continue taking Paracetamol for pain relief and consult with a healthcare professional for further evaluation and management. It is important to rule out any other potential causes for the swelling and pain, such as gout or rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nPlease note that this response is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment."

One possibility is appendicitis, which is characterized by pain in the lower right abdomen that may progress to severe pain if left untreated. Another possibility is gallstones or cholecystitis, which can cause pain in the upper right abdomen.\n\nHowever, since the pain is not very severe and comes and goes, it is important to consider other causes as well. Conditions such as muscle strain, gastrointestinal issues like gastritis or diverticulitis, or even urinary tract infections can also present with similar symptoms.\n\nTo determine the exact cause of the pain and provide appropriate treatment, it is recommended to consult with a healthcare professional. They will perform a thorough physical examination, review the patient's medical history, and may order additional tests such as blood work, ultrasound, or CT scan if necessary.\n\nIn the meantime, it is advisable for the patient to continue taking the prescribed medication for gastric pain, if any. However, if the pain worsens or becomes unbearable, it is important to seek immediate medical attention.",

Abortion is a serious decision and should not be taken lightly.\n\nLorazepam is a class D pregnancy drug, which means it has been associated with fetal harm when used during pregnancy. It can increase the risk of birth defects, developmental problems, and withdrawal symptoms in the newborn.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the risk of these complications depends on the dosage, duration of use, and individual factors. If you are currently tapering off Lorazepam under medical supervision, it is better than stopping abruptly.\n\nI recommend contacting your healthcare provider or going to a hospital to discuss your concerns and get proper guidance.

Abortion is a serious decision and should not be taken lightly.\n\nLorazepam is a class D pregnancy drug, which means it has been associated with fetal harm when used during pregnancy. It can increase the risk of birth defects, developmental problems, and withdrawal symptoms in the newborn.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the risk of these complications depends on the dosage, duration of use, and individual factors. If you are currently tapering off Lorazepam under medical supervision, it is better than stopping abruptly.\n\nI recommend contacting your healthcare provider or going to a hospital to discuss your concerns and get proper guidance.

Is it possible to get fat on just one side of the body like that?\n\n### Response:Based on the description you provided, it is possible to have fat accumulation on one side of the body. This condition is known as \"hidradenitis\" or \"hidradenitis suppurativa.\" It typically occurs when there is an imbalance in the production and elimination of sweat, leading to the formation of cysts and nodules in the affected area.\n\nHowever, based on your description of the lump being soft and not causing any pain or discomfort, it is less likely to be related to hidradenitis. Instead, it could be a normal fatty deposit or lipoma. Lipomas are harmless fatty tissue masses that can occur anywhere on the body and are usually painless.\n\nTo determine the exact nature of the lump, it would be best to consult with a healthcare professional who can perform a physical examination and possibly order further tests if necessary.",

However, if the blood vessels have a pulse and there is a cardiac dysfunction, it suggests that the heart is not able to effectively pump blood throughout the body.\n\nCardiac dysfunction refers to any abnormality or malfunction in the structure or function of the heart. It can be caused by various factors such as coronary artery disease, heart valve problems, heart muscle diseases (such as cardiomyopathy), or congenital heart defects.\n\nWhen a doctor detects a pulse in the blood vessels and also identifies cardiac dysfunction, it suggests that there may be an issue with the heart's ability to effectively pump blood. This can lead to symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness, or fluid retention.\n\nIt is important to consult with a cardiologist for further evaluation and management of cardiac dysfunction. They will perform additional tests, such as echocardiography or stress tests, to assess the structure and function of the heart, identify the underlying cause, and determine the appropriate treatment plan."

Tooth decay can be a common dental issue, but it is important to address it promptly to prevent further damage and potential tooth loss. The first step would be to schedule an appointment with a dentist as soon as possible. They will be able to assess the extent of the decay and recommend appropriate treatment options. In the meantime, you can try to maintain good oral hygiene by brushing your teeth at least twice a day with fluoride toothpaste, flossing daily, and avoiding sugary foods and beverages.",

No major injury to the sites was noticed aside from the generalized rash that was being treated.\n\n### Response:Hello,\n\nI'm sorry to hear about your experience with Elidel. The white patches you described are likely due to hypopigmentation, which is a known side effect of the medication. Hypopigmentation refers to a loss of pigmentation in certain areas of the skin, resulting in a lighter or whiter appearance.\n\nIn terms of fading, it can vary from person to person. Some individuals may experience partial or complete fading over time, while others may not see any improvement. The duration of fading can also differ. It is important to note that the time it takes for hypopigmentation to fade can be unpredictable.\n\nIf you are concerned about the appearance of the white patches, I would recommend discussing your options with a dermatologist. They may suggest various treatments depending on the severity and extent of the hypopigmentation. Potential treatment options may include:\n\n1. Topical corticosteroids: These medications can help reduce inflammation and promote pigment regeneration.\n2. Topical retinoids: These medications can help improve the turnover of skin cells and stimulate pigment production.\n3. Hydroquinone: This medication can help lighten areas of hypopigmentation, although its use is generally limited due to potential side effects.\n4. Tretino",

MS is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system, including the brain and spinal cord.\n\nThe presence of tingling symptoms on the face, arms, legs, and torso, along with intermittent symptoms on both sides of the body, can be indicative of MS.

These imaging findings are often seen in patients with MS.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that these symptoms and MRI findings alone do not definitively diagnose MS. Further evaluation, including a thorough clinical examination and additional tests such as cerebrospinal fluid analysis and visual evoked potentials, may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nI recommend consulting with a neurologist who specializes in MS to discuss the patient's symptoms and undergo further diagnostic testing.",

It is important to consult with a healthcare professional for further evaluation and diagnosis.\n\n3.

However, I am unable to diagnose or provide specific treatment recommendations without a physical examination. It is important to consult with a dentist or oral surgeon for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.\n\nAbscesses are localized pockets of pus that form as a result of infection. They can occur in various parts of the body, including the teeth. In the case of a dental abscess, it typically develops at the root of a tooth due to an infection in the dental pulp or the space between the tooth and the gum.\n\nThe spread of an abscess throughout the body is not common unless there are underlying systemic conditions or complications such as a weakened immune system or a bacterial infection that has spread beyond the oral cavity. In most cases, localized treatment is sufficient to resolve the abscess and prevent further complications.\n\nTo effectively treat the abscess and prevent its spread, your dentist may recommend drainage of the abscess, antibiotics if necessary, and possibly root canal therapy or extraction of the affected tooth. It is important to follow their instructions and complete the prescribed treatment plan to ensure proper healing and prevention of further infection.\n\nPlease consult with a dental professional for an accurate diagnosis",

Should I be worried about my condition or is it normal?\n\n### Response:Based on the information provided, there are a few concerns regarding your blood test results.\n\nFirstly, the decrease in ferritin levels after three months of iron supplements is concerning. Ferritin is a protein that stores iron in the body, and its levels should increase with iron supplementation. A decrease in ferritin suggests that your body may not be effectively utilizing the iron from the supplements. This could be due to underlying conditions such as malabsorption or inadequate iron intake.\n\nSecondly, the increase in lymphocytes in your blood is also concerning. Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell that plays a role in immune function. An increase in lymphocytes can indicate an infection or an overactive immune response. In the context of your symptoms, it is possible that the viral infection your parents had could have triggered an immune response in you as well.\n\nLastly, the increase in thrombocyte (platelet) levels after starting antibiotics could be a response to the infection in your urinary system. Thrombocytes are responsible for blood clotting, and an increase in their levels may indicate an increased risk of bleeding.\n\nConsidering these findings, it would be advisable to consult with your doctor again to discuss these results in more detail.

These findings may indicate a condition called blepharitis, which is inflammation of the eyelid and eyelash follicles.\n\nBlepharitis can be caused by various factors such as bacterial infection, excess oil production, or dry eyes. It is commonly associated with allergies and can lead to symptoms such as redness, itching, irritation, and dryness of the eyes.\n\nGiven your symptoms of dry eyes and allergies, it is possible that your blepharitis is related to these conditions. However, it would be best to consult with an ophthalmologist for a proper evaluation and diagnosis. They will be able to provide appropriate treatment options based on the underlying cause of your blepharitis.",

Can this disease make one blind?\n\n### Response:Hello,\n\nHMD (hereditary macular degeneration) is a genetic disorder that affects the macula, which is responsible for central vision. It leads to progressive degeneration and loss of central vision, while peripheral vision remains intact.\n\nThe maximum possible impact of HMD on a person's future vision can vary depending on the specific genetic mutation and the individual's age of onset. In some cases, HMD may progress slowly over many years, while in others, it can progress more rapidly. In severe cases, HMD can cause significant visual impairment and even lead to legal blindness. However, it is important to note that not all individuals with HMD will experience the same level of vision loss.\n\nWhile HMD cannot directly cause complete blindness, it can significantly impact a person's ability to see fine details and perform tasks requiring central vision, such as reading, recognizing faces, or driving.\n\nIt is essential for individuals with a family history of HMD or suspected symptoms to consult with an ophthalmologist for a comprehensive evaluation and appropriate management.",

I stopped taking Prednisone after 10 days, but my insomnia had not improved. Is insomnia a permanent side effect of Prednisone?\n\n### Response:Insomnia can be a temporary side effect of Prednisone, but it is not a permanent side effect. It is important to note that Prednisone is a corticosteroid medication commonly used to treat inflammation and suppress the immune system. Insomnia is a known side effect of Prednisone, especially when taken at higher doses or for prolonged periods of time.\n\nThe worsening of your insomnia after starting Prednisone suggests that it may have contributed to your sleep disturbances. However, it is also possible that other factors such as cough symptoms or anxiety related to the cough could have played a role.\n\nAfter stopping Prednisone, it is expected that your insomnia may improve over time as your body readjusts to its natural sleep-wake cycle without the influence of the medication. It is recommended to continue practicing good sleep hygiene habits such as maintaining a regular sleep schedule, avoiding stimulating activities before bedtime, and creating a relaxing sleep environment.\n\nIf your insomnia persists or worsens despite stopping Prednisone, I would advise consulting with your doctor to further evaluate and explore potential underlying causes or contributing factors. They may consider adjusting your treatment plan or prescribing additional medications or therapies to address the insomnia specifically.",

Heterotropia refers to a deviation of the eyes from the normal midline position. It can be temporary or intermittent and may occur in one or both eyes.\n\nThe sudden decrease in size of your right eye followed by it returning to normal suggests that there may be a reflex mechanism involved. This reflex is known as the accommodation reflex or the vergence-accommodation reflex.\n\nDuring this reflex, when the eyes are not properly aligned, the ciliary muscle in the eye contracts to change the shape of the lens, allowing for better focus and alignment of the eyes. This contraction of the ciliary muscle temporarily reduces the size of the eye, bringing it back into alignment.\n\nIt is important to note that heterotropia can have various causes, including refractive errors, strabismus (misaligned eyes), or other underlying conditions. Therefore, it is recommended to consult with an ophthalmologist for a thorough evaluation and diagnosis. They will be able to provide a more accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment if necessary.",

Now it is not healing even after a scar revision surgery. Thanks.\n\n### Response:Based on the description provided, it seems that there are a few factors contributing to the poor healing of the scar revision surgery.\n\nFirstly, involuntary frowning can indeed cause lines to run through the scar. This is because repeated contraction and relaxation of the muscles in the forehead can lead to creasing and indentation in the scar tissue.\n\nSecondly, the use of a vitamin C and silicone scar cream to attempt better removal of hyperpigmentation may be a potential problem. Some scar creams contain ingredients that can delay or impede the healing process, leading to poorer scar appearance.\n\nLastly, it is important to note that the depression and frustration you are experiencing due to the poor healing of the scar revision surgery can also have an impact on the overall healing process. Negative emotions can affect blood flow to the area, which can hinder the healing process.\n\nTo address these concerns, I would recommend the following steps:\n\n1. Consult with a plastic surgeon or dermatologist: It is essential to seek professional advice from a healthcare provider who specializes in scar management and reconstruction. They will be able to assess the wound and provide appropriate guidance and treatment options.\n\n2. Avoid making facial expressions that cause lines to run through the scar: While it may",

Consult with a plastic surgeon or dermatologist: It is essential to seek professional advice from a healthcare provider who specializes in scar management and reconstruction. They will be able to assess the wound and provide appropriate guidance and treatment options.\n\n2. Avoid making facial expressions that cause lines to run through the scar: While it may"

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.\n\n### Input:\nHello doctor,I am a 31-year-old male with a history of closed globe injury in the right eye 10 years ago. At that time, my vision in the right eye was hand movements only and I was diagnosed with a macular injury. Three months later, my vision slowly improved to 6/36. However, my right eye started to deviate (exotropia) and I started experiencing diplopia. My main problem is diplopia. I have used prisms, but of no use. When I try to focus on an image, I have severe diplopia. The diplopia disappears when I try to correct the squint. At present, I am doing higher studies and the diplopia is really bothering me. Will doing a squint surgery be of any use? Is there anything that I can try?\n\n### Response:Based on the information provided, it seems that you are experiencing diplopia due to a misalignment of the eyes, known as exotropia. The history of a closed globe injury and the improvement in vision over time suggest that there may be damage to the visual pathway or the muscles controlling eye movement.\n\nSquint surgery, also known as strabismus surgery, is a procedure performed to correct the alignment of the eyes and improve binocular vision. It involves repositioning or resecting the muscles that control eye movement. In your case, since diplopia persists despite using prisms, squint surgery may not be effective in alleviating your symptoms.\n\nThere are alternative treatment options that can be considered for managing diplopia in cases where surgery is not suitable or has not provided adequate relief. These include:\n\n1. Orthoptic exercises: These exercises aim to improve eye coordination and alignment. They may involve following moving targets with the eyes, performing visual acuity tasks, or focusing on specific targets while moving the eyes in certain patterns.\n\n2. Vision therapy: This involves a structured program of eye exercises, targeted at improving visual processing and eye coordination. It may include activities such as eye movements, convergence exercises, and near vision tasks.\n\n3. Pr",

        "input": "Hi doctor,I have a lower wisdom tooth that has been infected chronically for well over a year. I also have an upper molar that is broken decayed and has been like this for years. The wisdom tooth oozes green pus if you apply pressure with a cotton swab. The decayed tooth is mildly painful. I saw my dentist a few days ago, who did not seem overly concerned. She slightly cleaned the gums around the wisdom tooth and prescribed me Cephalexin and sent me on my way. I have been taking Cephalexin for a few days, and yet the tooth is still oozing. My throat is red and irritated, the gums inflamed and there is no swelling in the mouth. Also, my nostril on that side is tender and painful. I am severely worried about the infection spreading to either my heart or my brain. In fact, I read an article a few days ago about a 26 year old who died from a tooth infection spreading.I do not have a fever. I have mild nausea. It is tender on that side of my jaw. The dentist had said the next thing she could give me was Clindamycin, but I have a fear of the side effects of that medicine. I already have heart problems and mild stomach issues. I have read that Clindamycin can cause severe gastrointestinal problems and arrhythmias. She also suggested Zithromax, but I have had heart palpitations while on that medication as well. I am having the teeth removed by an oral surgeon in two weeks, but am afraid of dying from infection before then. What are my options? What is the best course of action? Are there other antibiotics for this? Am I dying from the infection already? Any of your advice or help is appreciated. My other possibly relevant health history is as follows: I have high blood pressure, tachycardia, high cholesterol and mild PVC\\s. I had a MRSA infection in my arm 10 years ago. I have many strep throat infections every year and frequent sinus issues. Also, I would like to mention that when I took smoothed Cephalexin capsule with a sip of water, I got a random salty taste in my mouth.",

The presence of green pus when pressure is applied to the wisdom tooth suggests that there may be bacterial spread within the tooth.\n\nThe symptoms of redness and tenderness in the throat, along with mild nausea, are indicative of an inflammatory response in the area. The presence of a broken tooth can also contribute to the spread of infection.\n\nThe patient's concern about the infection spreading to the heart or brain is valid. In rare cases, dental infections can be severe and potentially life-threatening if left untreated. It is important to address the infection promptly to prevent complications.\n\nThe dentist's initial treatment approach of prescribing Cephalexin and scheduling an oral surgery in two weeks is a reasonable course of action. However, considering the severity of the symptoms and the potential for spreading infection, it would be advisable to consider alternative antibiotic options before the scheduled oral surgery.\n\nOne option could be switching to a different antibiotic class, such as fluoroquinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin) or macrolides",

The fact that he had a good night's sleep during the sleep study but continues to have trouble sleeping at home suggests that the problem may not be fully resolved.\n\nRegarding the use of Flonaise (fluticasone propionate), it is a medication commonly used for nasal congestion caused by allergies or other conditions. While it can help relieve nasal congestion, it does not address the underlying cause of your son's difficulty breathing through his nose.\n\nAs for the concern about stunting his growth, it is important to note that the use of Flonaise for short periods (up to 10 days) is generally considered safe and does not have a significant impact on growth. However, long-term use or excessive dosing should be avoided.\n\nIn terms of the potential risks associated with allowing your son to continue experiencing difficulty breathing each night, it is essential to consider the severity of his symptoms. Obstructive sleep apnea can lead to various complications, including respiratory issues, daytime fatigue, behavioral problems, and developmental delays. Therefore, if his symptoms are severe and affect",

While it can help relieve nasal congestion, it does not address the underlying cause of your son's difficulty breathing through his nose.\n\nAs for the concern about stunting his growth, it is important to note that the use of Flonaise for short periods (up to 10 days) is generally considered safe and does not have a significant impact on growth. However, long-term use or excessive dosing should be avoided.\n\nIn terms of the potential risks associated with allowing your son to continue experiencing difficulty breathing each night, it is essential to consider the severity of his symptoms. Obstructive sleep apnea can lead to various complications, including respiratory issues, daytime fatigue, behavioral problems, and developmental delays. Therefore, if his symptoms are severe and affect"

To address your concerns, I will analyze the p24 antigen test results and provide some guidance.\n\nThe p24 antigen test is a commonly used test for detecting early HIV infection. It measures the presence of p24 antigen, which is produced during the early stages of HIV infection. The results of your p24 antigen test show an increase in count over time, starting from 0.125 on the fourth day to 0.540 on the nineteenth day.\n\nWhile an increase in p24 antigen count can be indicative of an ongoing HIV infection, it is important to consider other factors and perform additional tests to confirm the diagnosis. The PCR RNA test for HIV 1 and the ELISA test for HIV 2 were both negative, which suggests that these viruses were not detected in your system.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to remember that the p24 antigen test alone is not definitive for diagnosing HIV infection. To further evaluate your situation, I recommend undergoing a Western blot test, which is a more sensitive and specific test for confirming HIV infection.\n\nIn",

I am currently on Suboxone 12 mg, 6 in AM and 6 in PM. When I asked what they will be using to sedate, they said Fentanyl and Versed. I asked for Profol but got no answer. I spoke to a male nurse, not an anesthesiologist. If the Fenytal overrides the sub will I be in withdraw? Also, are there safety issues combining these medicines? Should I cancel this procedure?\n\n### Response:Hello,\n\nI'm sorry to hear about your upcoming cardiac cath procedure. As a doctor, I can provide some information regarding your concerns.\n\n1. Fentanyl and Versed are commonly used for sedation during procedures. Fentanyl is a strong opioid that provides pain relief and sedation, while Versed is a benzodiazepine that helps to further enhance the sedative effects.\n\n2. Suboxone contains buprenorphine, which is an opioid agonist. When used as directed, it can help manage opioid withdrawal symptoms. However, when combined with other opioids like fentanyl, there is a risk of precipitating withdrawal symptoms.\n\n3. It is important to discuss this combination with your anesthesiologist or the medical team performing the procedure. They will be able to assess your individual situation and make any necessary adjustments to ensure your safety and comfort during the procedure.\n\n4. Based on the information provided, it seems like you have not received a definitive answer regarding the use of Profol. It is always best to consult with your anesthesiologist or the medical team directly to clarify any concerns or questions you may have regarding the medications being used for your procedure.\n\n5. In terms of safety, combining fentanyl and suboxone can potentially increase the risk",

It is most effective when taken within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse.\n\nHowever, if you had sex again within three days after taking the I-pill, there is a possibility that you may still be at risk of pregnancy. The effectiveness of the I-pill decreases with each subsequent intercourse.\n\nTo determine the best course of action, it is recommended to consult with a healthcare professional or visit a sexual health clinic.

Hypothyroidism is a condition where the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone, leading to various symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, and sensitivity to cold.\n\nIn terms of treatment, hypothyroidism is usually managed with synthetic thyroid hormone medication, such as levothyroxine, which is taken daily for life. This medication helps to replace the deficient hormone and restore normal thyroid function.\n\nWhile alternative treatments like Ayurveda can be considered alongside conventional medicine, it is important to note that there is no known cure for hypothyroidism without medication. The goal of treatment is to manage symptoms and restore hormone levels to normal.\n\nIf you suspect you may have diabetes in addition to hypothyroidism, it is crucial to consult with both an endocrinologist (for thyroid issues) and an internist or diabetologist (for diabetes). They will be able to evaluate your specific situation and provide appropriate treatment plans.\n\nIt is always recommended to discuss your concerns and treatment options with your healthcare provider, as they will be able to provide personalized advice based on your individual health needs.",

The morning after pill is most effective when taken within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse.\n\n2. How effective will the morning after pill be in protecting from pregnancy?\nThe morning after pill is highly effective in preventing pregnancy when taken within the recommended time frame. It can significantly reduce the risk of pregnancy by up to 95%.\n\n3. How much will the pills previously taken lower the risk of pregnancy?\nThe combined contraceptive pill, if taken consistently and correctly, significantly reduces the risk of pregnancy. However, since the missed pill occurred recently, the effectiveness may be reduced.\n\n4. Given her current stage of ovulation, what is the risk of her becoming pregnant?\nThe risk of pregnancy without the protection of the combined contraceptive pill is higher during the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle, which typically occurs around the time of ovulation. Since her period stopped and she started taking the pill consistently, the risk of pregnancy may be lower. However, without the protection of the missed pill, the risk of pregnancy is higher.\n",

It is important to follow the prescribed treatment plan provided by the healthcare professional.\n\nIn the meantime, it is advisable for the patient to avoid contact with contaminated soil or environments where hookworm may be present.

They help build strength, improve flexibility, and burn calories. Examples include push-ups, pull-ups, squats, lunges, planks, and yoga poses. You can do these exercises anywhere, even at home.\n\n3. Strength training: Incorporating strength training exercises into your routine helps build muscle mass, which boosts metabolism and helps burn more calories. You can use free weights, resistance bands, or weight machines at a gym. However, you can also do bodyweight exercises like squats and lunges as strength training exercises.\n\nRemember to start slowly and gradually increase the intensity and duration of your workouts. It's important to listen to your body and avoid overexertion. Also, make sure to have a"

One possibility is osteoarthritis, which is a common type of arthritis that can affect the knees. It is more likely to occur in older individuals, but it can also affect younger people. Another possibility is a condition called patellofemoral pain syndrome, which is characterized by pain in the front of the knee. This can be caused by factors such as overuse, improper biomechanics, or muscle imbalances. Lastly, another potential cause could be a meniscus tear, which can occur due to twisting or direct trauma to the knee.\n\nTo determine the exact cause of the patient's symptoms, a thorough medical history, physical examination, and possibly imaging studies such as X-rays or an MRI may be necessary.

My wish would be to increase the penis dimensions without damaging my HPTA axis.\n\n### Response:Based on the information provided, it seems like you are concerned about the potential harmful effects of making another cycle of DHT gel and whether or not you should do a PCT (Post Cycle Therapy).\n\nFirstly, it is important to note that the use of DHT gel for the purpose of penis enlargement is not recommended. DHT gel is typically used for medical conditions such as male pattern baldness or prostate enlargement. It is not approved for use in penis enlargement.\n\nSecondly, it is crucial to consider the potential risks and side effects associated with long-term use of high-dose DHT. Prolonged use of DHT can suppress natural testosterone production, leading to decreased testosterone levels and potentially causing hormonal imbalances. This can have various negative effects on your body and overall health.\n\nAdditionally, it is essential to understand that DHT gel contains a high concentration of DHT, which is a potent androgen hormone. Excessive use of DHT gel over an extended period of time can disrupt the normal functioning of the HPTA (Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Testicular-Axis), which regulates hormone production in the body. Disruption of the HPTA axis can lead to decreased testosterone production and potentially permanent damage.\n\n",

The feeling of dizziness when turning sideways or experiencing a headache coming from deep within your left ear could be indicative of a migraine headache.\n\nTo alleviate these symptoms, it is recommended to take regular breaks from digital devices, practice good posture, adjust screen brightness and position, use artificial tears or lubricating eye drops, and consider wearing specialized computer glasses if necessary. If your symptoms persist or worsen, it would be advisable to consult with an eye care professional for a comprehensive evaluation and personalized treatment plan."

How many days does it take to get cured?\n\n### Response:I'm sorry to hear about your wife's condition. Peripartum cardiomyopathy is a serious heart condition that can occur during pregnancy or within the first few months after delivery. The treatment for this condition typically involves medications such as beta blockers and diuretics to improve heart function and manage symptoms.\n\nThe ejection fraction (EF) of 38% indicates that her heart is pumping out only 38% of the blood with each contraction, which is below the normal range. The flat T in the ECG reports suggests that her heart's electrical conduction system may also be affected.\n\nThe recovery time for peripartum cardiomyopathy can vary from person to person. In general, it may take several months to a year for the heart to fully recover and return to normal function. However, it's important to note that complete recovery is not guaranteed, and some women may experience ongoing heart problems.\n\nIt would be best for your wife to follow up regularly with her healthcare provider to monitor her progress and adjust her treatment plan as needed. Additionally, lifestyle modifications such as maintaining a healthy diet, regular exercise, and stress management can also contribute to her overall well-being and heart health.",

They may want to examine the area and provide additional treatment options, such as placing a dressing or prescribing medication to alleviate any discomfort.\n\nIn the meantime, make sure to continue rinsing with salt water every half an hour and avoid smoking or using straws, as these activities can dislodge the clot and worsen the condition."

There are several potential causes for this, and it is important to consider various possibilities.\n\nOne possible cause of blood in the urine is urinary tract infection (UTI). UTIs occur when bacteria enter the urinary tract and cause an infection. This can result in blood appearing in the urine.\n\nAnother potential cause is kidney stones. When kidney stones form and move through the urinary tract, they can cause damage to the lining of the ureter, leading to bleeding.\n\nIn some cases, blood in the urine may be a sign of a more serious condition such as kidney or bladder cancer. However, given the patient's age and lack of medical history, this is less likely.\n\nGiven the absence of known medical issues or past history of kidney problems or cancer, it is important to consider other factors.

Knowing that I get heavy cycles and my diet is very poor.\n\n### Response:Based on the symptoms you described, it is possible that your anemia could be due to iron deficiency. People with minor beta thalassemia can indeed develop iron deficiency anemia.\n\nIron is essential for the production of red blood cells, which carry oxygen throughout the body. Beta thalassemia is a genetic disorder that affects the production of hemoglobin, the protein responsible for carrying oxygen in red blood cells. In individuals with beta thalassemia, there may be a decreased ability to produce enough healthy red blood cells, leading to anemia.\n\nIron deficiency anemia occurs when there is a lack of iron in the body, which is necessary for the production of hemoglobin. This can happen if the diet lacks iron-rich foods or if there is excessive iron loss through menstruation or other sources.\n\nTo confirm whether your anemia is due to iron deficiency, it would be best to undergo further medical evaluation, including blood tests to assess your iron levels and a complete blood count (CBC) to evaluate the number and quality of your red blood cells.\n\nI recommend consulting with a healthcare professional who can provide a proper diagnosis and develop an appropriate treatment plan for you.",

Blurry vision can have various causes, including refractive errors such as nearsightedness or farsightedness. However, since you mentioned that the blurry vision is permanent and present in only one eye, it is less likely to be related to refractive errors.\n\nIn such cases, the most common cause of permanent blurry vision in one eye is a condition called monocular vision loss.

Please suggest what we can do in this case and shall we switch her milk to Lactogen or some other company?\n\n### Response:Based on the description provided, it seems that the stronger twin baby is experiencing difficulty with breastfeeding and is not gaining weight adequately. This could be due to several factors, including insufficient milk intake, poor latch, or an underlying medical condition.\n\nTo address these concerns, I would recommend the following steps:\n\n1. Ensure proper positioning and latch during breastfeeding: The baby may need assistance with proper positioning and attaching correctly to the breast. A lactation consultant or healthcare provider can provide guidance on proper latch techniques.\n\n2. Increase the frequency of feeds: If the baby is taking around 45 ml of milk per feed, try increasing the number of feeds per day to meet their caloric needs. Aim for at least 8-12 feeds per day, spreading them out every 3-4 hours.\n\n3. Offer domperidone: Domperidone is a medication that can help increase milk supply by increasing the contractions of the milk-producing cells in the breast. It is available by prescription in some countries and can be considered under medical supervision.\n\n4. Switch to a different milk formula: If the baby is still not gaining weight adequately despite trying different techniques and interventions, it may be necessary to switch to a different milk formula",

Two of them are a little more than 3 cm at different places in the uterus. In the past, I have been operated for endometriosis level 4. As usual, the gynecologist is suggesting a hysterectomy. But since I am in my perimenopausal phase, can the fibroids shrink with medication? I have been suggested Fibroease.\n\n### Response:As a doctor, I can provide some information on the treatment options for uterine fibroids. Hysterectomy is a surgical procedure that involves removing the entire uterus, and it is typically recommended for symptomatic fibroids that are causing significant symptoms. However, if you are in your perimenopausal phase, there are alternative treatment options that may be considered before proceeding with a hysterectomy.\n\nOne such option is medication. Fibroids can sometimes shrink with the use of certain medications. The most commonly prescribed medication for fibroids is called GnRH agonists, such as leuprolide acetate or goserelin. These medications work by suppressing the hormones that stimulate the growth of fibroids. By reducing the levels of these hormones, the fibroids may gradually shrink over time.\n\nAnother medication that has been used to treat fibroids is the oral contraceptive pill (OCP). The combination OCPs containing estrogen and progestin have been shown to reduce the size of fibroids in some women. However, it is important to note that not all women respond to this treatment, and the benefits may vary.\n\nIt is essential to discuss these treatment options with your gynecologist, as they will be able to evaluate your specific case and",

She hit all of her milestones in terms of rolling over, crawling and walking (walked at 14.5 months), but is a toe walker. Her left leg (to us) is weaker than her right and her left leg does not bend as much as her right leg. She began to speak around 10 months of age then her speech left. We came to find out she had chronic fluid and a month back she had tubes placed. I am hearing more vowel and consonants now but no true words yet. She makes fine eye contact. Her non-verbal communication is good. She responds to her name but not always. She is beginning to learn more of what we are saying, she plays with some toys, is not terribly social.

It assesses the competence of these laboratories to perform specific tests and calibrations. NABL accreditation is recognized by the government and is considered as a mark of quality.\n\nCAP (College of American Pathologists) is an international organization that provides accreditation to pathology laboratories.

How much should men be stretching at 25, 30, 35, 40, 45? Does the need to be flexible vary by age?\n\n### Response:Eating habits and certain foods can have an impact on sleep. Consuming large meals close to bedtime or eating foods that are high in fat, sugar, and caffeine can disrupt sleep patterns. It is recommended to avoid heavy meals and stimulants such as caffeine and nicotine close to bedtime.\n\nAs for stretching, it is important for individuals of all ages to engage in regular stretching exercises. Stretching helps improve flexibility, which is crucial for maintaining good posture and preventing muscle imbalances. However, the specific stretching routine may vary based on age.\n\nFor younger individuals (25 years old or younger), it is generally recommended to perform dynamic stretching exercises before physical activity. These exercises involve moving the body through a range of motion, such as leg swings or arm circles.\n\nFor middle-aged individuals (30-40 years old), static stretching exercises are often incorporated into their routine. These exercises involve holding stretched positions for a period of time without bouncing or overstretching.\n\nFor older individuals (40 years old and above), it is important to focus on both dynamic and static stretching exercises. However, the emphasis shifts towards maintaining flexibility and preventing muscle loss rather than improving it.",

In general, patients with rheumatoid arthritis should have regular follow-up appointments with their rheumatologist to monitor their condition and adjust treatment as necessary.\n\nThe frequency of visits can vary depending on the individual and the severity of their symptoms. In your case, considering your limited funds and the fact that you are already taking Naproxen, it may be possible to space out your doctor visits. However, it is important to have regular check-ups to ensure that your symptoms are well-controlled and to monitor any potential side effects of medications.\n\nI would recommend discussing this with your private doctor to determine an appropriate visit schedule based on your specific needs and budget. They will be able to assess your condition and provide personalized advice regarding the frequency of visits.\n\nAdditionally, it is crucial to continue working closely with your NHS rheumatologist once your slot becomes available. They will be able to prescribe and monitor the effectiveness of DMARDs (such as Methotrexate) and other medications specific to your condition.\n\nRemember, early and regular medical intervention can help manage symptoms, prevent complications, and improve overall quality of life.",

I tried a statin but the muscle pain was too great. In my EKG I have RBBB or LAFB which 14 years back after a stress test I was told that I was probably born with it. I had gone to see the cardiologist then because of getting skipped beats and GERD he told me to ignore them. Last time I had an EKG was in the ER for six months when I had a weird pain in back and side. They checked out heart anyway and said it was fine. Probably just a colicky gallbladder.

It lasts a second or two but may repeat several times before stopping in five minutes or so. I went out in the garden today to dig a bit and wearing my HR monitor (I have got health anxiety, anxiety disorder as well as depression).

Costochondritis is an inflammation of the cartilage that connects the ribs to the breastbone.\n\nThe fact that the pain started hurting with each heartbeat when the patient was wearing their HR monitor suggests that there may be some correlation between the pain and the heart rate. However, it is important to note that costochondritis is not directly related to the heart and the pain is typically not associated with elevated heart rates.\n\nConsidering the patient's age, history of panic attacks and anxiety disorder, as well as their long-term use of Benzodiazepines, it is possible that their symptoms could be exacerbated by anxiety or medication side effects.\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms, it would be advisable for them to consult with their primary care physician or seek urgent care at an emergency department. The healthcare provider will be able to evaluate the patient's symptoms, perform a physical examination, and order any necessary tests to determine the cause of the pain and rule out any underlying cardiac conditions.",

I decided not to have a baby who is mentally retarded. Please suggest me your valuable advice.\n\n### Response:Based on the information provided, it seems like you have concerns about the results of your targeted imaging for fetal anomalies (TIFFA) scan. The normal findings in most areas suggest that there are no significant abnormalities in your baby's development. However, the reports mentioning hypoplastic nasal bone and higher normal values of amniotic fluid can be indicative of certain conditions that may require further evaluation.\n\nRegarding your questions:\n1. If we go for genetic amniocentesis and the results are positive for Down syndrome, can I terminate the pregnancy in my 28th week of pregnancy?\n   - The decision to terminate a pregnancy due to a diagnosis of Down syndrome is a highly personal one and should be discussed with your healthcare provider. In many countries, including India, the legal limit for abortion is usually around 24 weeks of gestation. However, the decision may vary depending on local laws and ethical considerations.\n\n2. How safe is it to go for amniocentesis test?\n   - Amniocentesis is a relatively safe procedure, but like any medical intervention, it carries some risks. These risks include a small chance of miscarriage (approximately 1 in 300-500) and an increased risk of premature labor",

However, there are several possible causes for this condition.\n\n1. Hypertrophic Scarring: This occurs when the body's healing response causes excessive collagen production, resulting in a raised or thickened scar.\n\n2. Keloid Scarring: Keloids are raised, pearly-surfaced scars that grow beyond the boundaries of the original wound. They often have a rubbery or fibrous texture.\n\n3. Post-Inflammatory Hyperpigmentation (PIH): PIH is a condition where the skin becomes darker in the area affected by inflammation or injury. It can occur after acne, burns, or other forms of inflammation.\n\n4. Scar Revision Surgery: In some cases, surgical intervention may be necessary to improve the appearance of a scar. Dermatologic surgeons can perform procedures such as scar excision, skin grafting, or flap reconstruction.\n\nTo determine the exact cause of the white scar and provide appropriate treatment recommendations, it would be best to consult with a dermatologist or plastic surgeon who can evaluate the scar in person.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.\n\n### Input:\nHello doctor,I am a 50-year-old male. I had genital warts five years ago, had them removed via cauterization and received three injections of HPV vaccine Gardasil. The doctor said the vaccine would cure the virus, but after a year, warts reappeared and until now they are still in my scrotum, and they are itchy but not painful. My question is that can I have sex with my partner given my current condition? Have I got cured by HPV vaccine?\n\n### Response:Based on the information provided, it seems that you have not been fully cured of the HPV infection despite receiving the HPV vaccine and undergoing treatment for genital warts. The reappearance of warts after a year indicates that the infection is still present.\n\nRegarding your question about sexual activity, it is important to consult with your healthcare provider for personalized advice. In general, it is recommended to avoid sexual activity until both partners have been adequately treated and have completed any necessary treatment or follow-up care. This will help reduce the risk of transmitting the infection to your partner and potentially spreading it to other areas of the body.\n\nI would advise you to schedule an appointment with your healthcare provider to discuss your current condition and explore further treatment options. They will be able to provide you with more specific guidance based on your individual situation.",

And after one week, I started bleeding and right now do not know why I am still bleeding? Is it my period that came again?\n\n### Response:Based on the patient's description, it is possible that the severe back pain and lower abdomen pain were caused by the i-pill. The i-pill is a form of emergency contraception that works by preventing ovulation and thickening the cervical mucus to block sperm from reaching the egg. However, it does not protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs).\n\nIf the i-pill was taken correctly within 72 hours after unprotected intercourse, it should have prevented pregnancy. However, it is still possible to experience side effects such as abdominal pain or irregular bleeding.\n\nThe continued bleeding after one week could be due to a few reasons:\n\n1. Period: It is possible that the bleeding is a regular menstrual period. Menstrual bleeding can sometimes start earlier or later than expected, especially after intercourse or the use of emergency contraception.\n\n2. Spotting or breakthrough bleeding: Some women may experience spotting or breakthrough bleeding after using the i-pill.

Stage D is the final stage of heart failure, characterized by severe symptoms and reduced life expectancy.\n\nThe symptoms your uncle is experiencing, such as shortness of breath, swelling in the abdomen and feet, wheezing, and coughing, are consistent with advanced heart failure.

HSV infections commonly occur in the mouth area and can spread to other parts of the body, including the nose and throat.\n\nThe presence of a red bump on your nose above the mustache, along with the discharge from the openings, suggests that you may have a primary infection of HSV. The symptoms you mentioned, such as fever and lymph node inflammation, are also consistent with an HSV infection.\n\nIt is important to note that HSV infections are highly contagious and can be spread through direct contact with an infected person's lips or mouth area. Since you mentioned that you have not had sexual contact for seven years, it is less likely that this is a sexually transmitted infection.\n\nTo confirm the diagnosis and determine the severity of the infection, I would recommend visiting a healthcare professional who can perform a physical examination and possibly order additional tests, such as a viral culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test.\n\nIn the meantime, you can take the following measures to alleviate symptoms and promote healing:\n\n1.

This suggests that the underlying cause of the condition may not be Tacrolimus-related.\n\nTherefore, I would recommend considering alternative treatment options. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. Topical corticosteroids: Apply a mild to moderate-strength topical corticosteroid cream or ointment (e.g., hydrocortisone 1%) directly to the affected areas of the lips twice daily for a few weeks. This can help reduce inflammation and promote healing.\n\n2. Avoiding triggers: Identify and avoid any potential triggers that may be exacerbating the condition, such as harsh skincare products, excessive moisturizing, or certain foods.\n\n3. Moisturizer adjustments: If the patient has been using"

Plus they have been infected for so long. I have also read that after surgery, it could reoccur.\n\n### Response:Based on the description you provided, it seems like you are experiencing a condition called preauricular sinus. Preauricular sinus is a congenital abnormality characterized by the presence of a pit or cleft in the skin just in front of the ear. These pits can sometimes become infected and lead to discharge.\n\nThe presence of smelly discharge and swelling in one ear suggests that the infection has progressed. It is important to seek medical attention for this condition as it may require intervention.\n\nIn terms of surgical options, antibiotic treatment followed by surgical drainage is typically recommended for cases of chronic infection. However, the success rate of surgery may be lower if the infection has been present for a long time.\n\nI would recommend scheduling an appointment with an otolaryngologist (ear, nose, and throat specialist) who can assess your condition and provide appropriate treatment options based on the severity of the infection. They may also discuss the possibility of preventive measures such as regular cleaning of the area to reduce the risk of recurrence.\n\nPlease note that this response does not constitute medical advice, and it is essential to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.",

It's understandable that you are concerned about the number of injections recommended for hormone blocking.

These medications specifically target the HER2 protein, which is often overexpressed in breast cancer cells. They can be used in combination with chemotherapy or after completion of chemotherapy to help reduce the risk of recurrence.\n\nAnother alternative treatment option could be radiation therapy. This treatment involves using high-energy X-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or shrink tumors. It can be used before surgery (neoadjuvant radiation) to reduce the size of the tumor, or after surgery (adjuvant radiation) to destroy any remaining cancer cells.\n\nIt's important to note that the final decision regarding treatment should be made in consultation with your mother's oncologist.

So, I would like to take DHEA supplements for beard growth, is it fine?\n\n### Response:As a doctor, I would advise against taking DHEA supplements for beard growth. DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone) is a hormone that is naturally produced by the adrenal glands in the body. It plays a role in various bodily functions, including hormone production and metabolism.\n\nIn terms of beard growth, DHEA supplements may not be effective. DHEA levels in the body are regulated by hormonal feedback loops and do not directly affect hair growth. Additionally, DHEA supplementation can have potential side effects, including increased risk of prostate cancer and adverse effects on liver function.\n\nInstead of relying on DHEA supplements, it would be more beneficial for you to focus on maintaining overall health and well-being. This can include adopting a balanced diet, engaging in regular exercise, managing stress levels, and ensuring proper sleep. These lifestyle factors can contribute to optimal hormone production and overall health, which may support beard growth.\n\nIt is important to consult with your healthcare provider before starting any new supplements or making changes to your medication regimen.

It is important to note that I am an AI language model and not a doctor, so I cannot provide a diagnosis or medical advice. However, I can give you some possible explanations:\n\n1.

The other abortion pill (misoprostol), when taken as prescribed, usually causes uterine contractions and expulsion of the pregnancy tissue. If these contractions do not occur or are ineffective, it can result in delayed or inadequate bleeding.\n\n3. In some cases, the pregnancy may not be at an early enough stage for the abortion pill to be effective. If the pregnancy is too far along or if there are complications, surgical abortion may be necessary.\n\n4.

Your resting heart rate of 98 bpm is within the normal range for adults.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that individual variations exist, and some people may have naturally higher resting heart rates. Factors such as physical fitness, stress levels, caffeine intake, and certain medications can also influence heart rate.\n\nIn your case, since you have no symptoms and your heart rate is within the normal range, there is likely no cause for immediate concern. However, it would be beneficial to monitor your heart rate over time to ensure it remains within the normal range.\n\nRegular check-ups with your primary care physician are recommended to assess your overall cardiovascular health. They can evaluate your blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other risk factors for heart disease.\n\nIf your girlfriend continues to be concerned, it may be helpful to provide her with educational resources about normal heart rate variations and reassure her that you are being monitored by a healthcare professional.\n\nPlease consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding your specific situation.",

Please help.\n\n### Response:Based on the patient's description, it appears that they have experienced a corneal abrasion in their left eye due to the exposure of two small drops of glue. The presence of black spots on the whitish part of the eye suggests the development of epithelial ingrowth, which is a common complication following corneal abrasions.\n\nEpithelial ingrowth occurs when the cells from the outer layer of the cornea (epithelium) start to grow into the deeper layers of the cornea. This can cause opacity and discoloration of the affected area.\n\nTo manage this condition, I would recommend the following steps:\n\n1. Cleanse the affected area gently with a clean, damp cotton swab or a mild saline solution to remove any debris or bacteria.\n2. Use antibiotic eye drops or ointment as prescribed by your doctor to prevent infection.\n3. Wear a protective eye patch over the affected eye during sleep to prevent any further trauma or rubbing.\n4.

        "response": "Based on the patient's description, it appears that they have experienced a corneal abrasion in their left eye due to the exposure of two small drops of glue. The presence of black spots on the whitish part of the eye suggests the development of epithelial ingrowth, which is a common complication following corneal abrasions.\n\nEpithelial ingrowth occurs when the cells from the outer layer of the cornea (epithelium) start to grow into the deeper layers of the cornea. This can cause opacity and discoloration of the affected area.\n\nTo manage this condition, I would recommend the following steps:\n\n1. Cleanse the affected area gently with a clean, damp cotton swab or a mild saline solution to remove any debris or bacteria.\n2. Use antibiotic eye drops or ointment as prescribed by your doctor to prevent infection.\n3. Wear a protective eye patch over the affected eye during sleep to prevent any further trauma or rubbing.\n4. Avoid touching or rubbing your eyes, as this can further aggravate the condition and delay healing.\n5.

The foul-smelling and dark urine, along with the ongoing issue for a year, suggest that there may be bacteria present in the urinary system.\n\nTo confirm the diagnosis and determine the appropriate treatment, I would recommend the following steps:\n\n1. Collect a clean-catch urine sample: Instruct the patient to empty their bladder completely and then collect a sample in a clean container.\n2. Perform a urinalysis: Analyze the collected urine sample using a urine dipstick or send it to a laboratory for further testing. This will help identify the presence of bacteria, white blood cells, red blood cells, and other markers of infection.\n3. Prescribe antibiotics if necessary: If a urinary tract infection is confirmed, antibiotics are typically prescribed to treat the infection. The choice of antibiotic will depend on the susceptibility of the bacteria present in the urine.\n4. Provide self-care measures: Along with antibiotic treatment, recommendations for self-care measures such as drinking plenty of fluids, urinating frequently, and practicing good hygiene can help alleviate symptoms and promote healing.\n",

This can potentially affect fertility as it may result in the absence or blockage of one of the fallopian tubes.\n\nIn your case, four follicles have ruptured from the left ovary, which indicates that ovulation is occurring normally on that side. However, it is concerning that a follicle also ruptured from the right ovary. This suggests that there may be an issue with the right fallopian tube or its connection to the uterus.\n\nGiven your situation, it is important to consult with a reproductive specialist who can further evaluate your specific case. They may recommend additional diagnostic tests such as hysterosalpingography (HSG) or hysteroscopy to assess the condition of the uterus and fallopian tubes.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that the endometrial lining of 9 mm is considered to be within the normal range for fertility. However, the presence of a unicornate uterus with a left rudimentary horn adds an extra layer of complexity and may increase the risk of complications during pregnancy.\n\nI understand that this may be discouraging, but it is crucial to seek professional guidance to understand",

My husband and I hardly have sex because it hurts me so badly. What can I do to stop it from being so painful?\n\n### Response:As a doctor, I understand that you are experiencing pain during sexual intercourse due to a small vaginal opening. There are several steps you can take to alleviate this pain and improve your sexual experience. Here are some recommendations:\n\n1. Kegel exercises: Strengthening the muscles in and around the vagina can help improve lubrication and elasticity. These exercises can be done anywhere, even while sitting or standing, by tightening the muscles for a few seconds and then releasing them.\n\n2. Vaginal dilators: Using vaginal dilators can help widen the vaginal opening gradually. Start with the smallest dilator and work your way up to the largest one over time. It is important to use water-based lubricant when using dilators to prevent irritation.\n\n3. Hormonal creams or suppositories: Applying hormonal creams or using vaginal suppositories can help increase vaginal lubrication. These products contain estrogen, which helps in maintaining healthy vaginal tissue. However, it is essential to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any hormonal treatment.\n\n4.

Stretch marks can be caused by various factors, including puberty, pregnancy, rapid weight gain, or hormonal changes. While there is no magic pill to completely remove stretch marks, there are several treatment options available to help improve their appearance.\n\n1. Topical Creams: Over-the-counter creams containing ingredients like retinoids, corticosteroids, or vitamin A can help fade stretch marks over time. These creams need to be applied regularly and consistently for several months to see noticeable results.\n\n2. Laser Treatment: Laser therapy, such as fractional laser treatment, can be effective in reducing the appearance of stretch marks. This procedure uses heat energy to stimulate collagen production, which helps improve the texture and color of stretch marks. Multiple sessions may be required, and the results vary depending on the individual and the severity of the stretch marks.\n\n3. Microdermabrasion: This procedure involves using a machine to remove the top layer of skin, which can help improve the appearance of stretch marks. However, it is important to note that microdermabrasion is not a permanent solution and may require repeated treatments to maintain the results.\n\n4. Surgical Procedures: In some cases,",

In these five years, she has not even bled for a single day. Why is she bleeding all of a sudden? What can be the cause?\n\n### Response:Based on the information provided, it is possible that your mother is experiencing a condition called menorrhagia. Menorrhagia refers to heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding that lasts for more than seven days or requires frequent changes of sanitary pads or tampons.\n\nThere are several potential causes for sudden onset of menorrhagia, including:\n\n1. Hormonal imbalances: Fluctuations in hormone levels, such as those seen in conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), can disrupt the normal menstrual cycle and lead to heavy bleeding.\n\n2. Uterine fibroids: Fibroids are noncancerous growths that develop in or around the uterus. They can cause heavy or prolonged bleeding during menstruation.\n\n3. Endometrial polyps: These are small, noncancerous growths that develop in the lining of the uterus. They can sometimes cause excessive bleeding.\n\n4. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID): PID is an infection of the female reproductive organs, often caused by sexually transmitted infections (STIs). It can lead to changes in the uterus and disrupt the menstrual cycle, resulting in heavy bleeding.\n\n5. C",

It is important to take these pills within the recommended time frame to maximize their effectiveness.\n\nPlease note that the I-pill does not protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs), so it is still important to use barrier methods such as condoms to prevent the spread of STIs."

Cold sores are caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV) and can be triggered by various factors such as stress, sunlight exposure, or immunosuppression.\n\nTo help diagnose and provide appropriate treatment, I would need to see photographs of the cold sores. Please consult with a dermatologist or healthcare professional who can guide you on how to take and send photos. They will be able to assess the severity and recommend the best course of action for your specific condition.\n\nIn the meantime, it is important to continue taking Acivir 800 as prescribed by your healthcare provider. Acivir 800 is an antiviral medication that can help reduce the severity and duration of cold sores. However, it is not a cure for cold sores and may not prevent future outbreaks.\n\nIt is also worth noting that there are several self-care measures that can help alleviate the symptoms of cold sores. These include avoiding triggers such as sunlight, stress, and certain foods; practicing good oral hygiene by keeping the mouth clean and moisturized; and using over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen to alleviate discomfort",

It commonly occurs when food or debris becomes trapped between the tooth and the gum, leading to infection and inflammation.\n\nSince the patient's wisdom teeth were not showing during the dental cleaning, it is possible that the bump is due to impaction or eruption of the wisdom teeth, causing the gum tissue to become irritated and infected.\n\nTo confirm the diagnosis and provide appropriate treatment, it is recommended for the patient to visit their dentist or oral surgeon.

I have severe phimosis. I know phimosis can be treated, but my biggest concern is that I now have blue-looking veins from the shaft of my penis to the actual penis head that is supposed to be exposed. Is it serious? I have an appointment with a urologist in two weeks but the suspense is really killing me. Is it common? or can it be treated? Will I be able to successfully retract the penis head? I also feel pain sensation when I touch the hole at the tip of the penis. Please help. Of note, I smoke marijuana. I have attached photos for your reference.\n\n### Response:Based on the description you provided, it seems like you are experiencing a condition called phimosis, which is the inability to fully retract the foreskin of the penis. The presence of blue-looking veins from the shaft of the penis to the penis head is a common finding in patients with phimosis.\n\nThe concern you mentioned about the blue-looking veins is valid, as they can be a sign of increased pressure within the penis. This increased pressure can occur due to the inability to fully retract the foreskin, leading to trapped blood and compromised blood flow.\n\nIt is important to note that phimosis can be treated, and the treatment options depend on the severity of the condition. In mild cases, topical steroid creams or lubricants may be recommended to help with lubrication and reduce inflammation. For more severe cases, a circumcision procedure may be necessary.\n\nRegarding your concern about pain sensation when touching the tip of the penis, this could be due to the presence of inflammation or irritation. It is advisable to avoid smoking marijuana, as it can further exacerbate these symptoms and delay the healing process.\n\nI would recommend reaching out to your urologist as soon as possible to discuss your concerns and explore treatment options. They will be able",

I just want to know about its long term consequences as I am afraid of breast and ovarian cancer.\n\n### Response:As a doctor, I understand your concerns about donating eggs. Here are some important points to consider:\n\n1. PCOD (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) and Egg Donation: PCOD can affect your fertility and make it more challenging to conceive naturally. However, it does not necessarily mean that you cannot conceive in the future. If you choose to donate eggs, it is important to understand that the success rate of egg donation depends on various factors such as your age, overall health, and response to hormonal stimulation.\n\n2. Long-Term Consequences: There is no direct link between donating eggs and developing breast or ovarian cancer. The risk of developing these cancers is influenced by multiple factors, including family history, age, and other genetic factors. It is essential to discuss your concerns with your healthcare provider who can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.\n\n3. Hormonal Treatment: If you decide to proceed with egg donation, you may be offered hormonal stimulation medications to enhance your egg production. These medications are carefully monitored and regulated to minimize any potential risks. Your healthcare provider will closely monitor your response to the medication and ensure your safety throughout the process.\n\n4.

These instructions may include specific guidelines regarding alcohol consumption during the healing period.\n\nI would recommend consulting with your dermatologist or aesthetician for personalized advice regarding your specific situation and to discuss any concerns you may have about the impact of alcohol on your healing process."

The current status of your HBV infection is as follows:\n\n1. HBeAg - negative (0.010): HBeAg (hepatitis B e antigen) is a protein produced by the virus and its presence indicates an active infection. A negative result suggests that the virus is not actively replicating.\n\n2. HBV E antibody or Ag - positive (0.031): The presence of HBV E antibodies or antigen indicates previous exposure to the virus or current infection. A positive result suggests immunity or ongoing infection.\n\n3. HBV DNA quantitative (PCR) less than 17.1 IU/mL: The PCR test measures the amount of viral DNA in your blood. A low viral load indicates successful suppression of the virus, which is important for managing the infection and preventing liver damage.\n\nBased on these results, it appears that your HBV infection is well-controlled with a low viral load. This indicates that treatment can potentially help you achieve a negative status for HBV.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the cure rate for hepatitis B can vary depending on several factors,",

She recently suffered a more chronic depressive episode and went out of town for ketamine infusion therapy. The infusions were very successful, and the psychiatrist who was assessing her for the infusions suggested that she did not need the Lamotrigine, that it was ineffective for treating depression in bipolar II. She tapered off the Lamotrigine, which was very difficult.It has been three to four weeks since her last dose of Lamotrigine, and nine weeks since her infusions. She is feeling very moody and depressed, irritability, fatigue, loss of focus. The question is, do you think she needs to go back on the Lamotrigine? Or does she need to get a booster shot of Ketamine? Both are difficult solutions. Getting off the Lamotrigine was awful, and getting Ketamine requires out of town travel, etc. Kindly advice.",

Getting off the Lamotrigine was awful, and getting Ketamine requires out of town travel, etc. Kindly advice.\n\n### Response:Based on the patient's description, it seems that the patient is experiencing symptoms of depression despite being off Lamotrigine for a period of time. Lamotrigine is commonly used for maintenance treatment of bipolar depression, so it is possible that it may have been effective in managing her depressive episodes.\n\nHowever, since the patient's symptoms have not improved significantly after stopping Lamotrigine, it may be necessary to reconsider the treatment plan. One option could be to restart Lamotrigine at a lower dose and gradually increase it if necessary. This approach can help minimize any withdrawal effects.\n\nAnother option to consider is a booster shot of Ketamine infusion therapy. Ketamine infusions have shown promising results in treating depression, especially in patients with treatment-resistant depression. It is important to discuss this option with the psychiatrist who assessed her for the infusions to determine if another infusion session would be beneficial.\n\nUltimately, the decision should be made in consultation with the patient's healthcare provider, taking into account the severity of her symptoms, response to previous treatments, and any contraindications or potential side effects of the medications being considered.",

The pain and foul-smelling yellow stuff coming out of the bottom right tooth could indicate an infection at the surgical site.\n\nInfections after oral surgery are not uncommon and can occur due to various reasons such as poor oral hygiene, delayed healing, or bacterial contamination during the procedure. The presence of headaches could be related to the infection or inflammation.\n\nI recommend the patient to seek immediate medical attention from their dentist or oral surgeon. They will need to be evaluated and possibly treated with antibiotics, pain medication, and possibly drainage of the abscess if necessary. It is important to address these symptoms promptly to prevent further complications and promote healing.",

IntraLasik involves creating a corneal flap using a blade or a laser, and then reshaping the cornea using an excimer laser. The flap is then returned to its original position.\n\nContoura Lasik, on the other hand, is a newer version of the laser vision correction procedure. It is performed using a femtosecond laser, which creates a customized treatment plan based on the individual's unique corneal topography. This allows for more precise and personalized correction of refractive errors compared to traditional methods like IntraLasik.\n\nIn summary, the main difference between IntraLasik and Contoura Lasik is that Contoura Lasik uses a customized treatment plan based on the individual's corneal topography, providing more precise and personalized correction compared to IntraLasik.",

It has been almost three weeks since I stopped Lyrica, Pregabalin completely for back pain. For the last week I have been experiencing something different which can be best described as random pressure or light pain almost behind both the ear lobes, sometimes the feeling is localized just there other times it travels towards the neck, occasionally towards the mastoid bone or it extends towards the lower jawline. I have been crazily searching to see if this is a result of any swollen lymph node fearing cancer but I could not find anything out of the ordinary on the body. Very rarely I feel this pressure going upwards to the ear and even more rarely a sudden pain arises inside the ear too but I hear no ringing or sounds. The weirdest thing is today I woke up with this sensation and I could feel heaviness behind my ears.This has come after an acute sinus infection, cough, night sweats (for which I had to take antibiotics) that hit me when I started tapering off Lyrica last month. I have had chronic sinus issues in the past too but this one was different, never had it progress to this level. I have uploaded an image of where exactly the pain or pressure originates but right now the pain or pressure is pretty spread out randomly across the neck.

Now I am 22 years old. So, is it possible to get back that previous size if I follow any instructions advised by you? I do not drink or smoke.\n\n### Response:As a doctor, I can provide you with some information on the potential effects of excessive masturbation on penis size. However, it's important to note that there are several factors that contribute to penis size, including genetics and hormonal levels.\n\nExcessive masturbation may lead to temporary changes in penis size due to the increased blood flow during arousal and orgasm. However, it is unlikely that these changes will be permanent. With proper sexual health practices and lifestyle modifications, it is possible to maintain a healthy penis and potentially enhance its appearance over time.\n\nTo improve your penis size, I would recommend the following:\n\n1. Maintain a healthy lifestyle: Ensure you are getting enough sleep, eating a balanced diet, and staying hydrated. These factors can have a positive impact on overall health and hormone levels.\n\n2. Engage in regular exercise: Physical activity, such as weightlifting, can help increase testosterone levels and promote overall penile health.\n\n3. Practice good hygiene: Keep the area around your penis clean and dry to prevent infections and promote healthy skin.\n\n4. Avoid excessive masturbation: While it may be difficult, try to reduce the frequency of masturbation to give your penis time",

I have shown to many doctors but did not get a good result. I have found now that lastly, I will have to go for laser treatment. Please suggest me what to do.\n\n### Response:As a doctor, I would recommend considering several factors before deciding on laser treatment for your deep acne scars. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. Consult with a dermatologist: It is important to consult with a dermatologist who specializes in treating skin conditions and has experience with laser treatments. They will be able to assess your specific condition and provide personalized recommendations.\n\n2. Understand the different types of lasers: There are various types of lasers available for treating acne scars, including ablative lasers (such as CO2 lasers) and non-ablative lasers (such as fractional lasers). Ablative lasers remove the top layer of skin to induce new collagen production, while non-ablative lasers stimulate collagen growth without removing the surface layer.\n\n3. Consider multiple sessions: Laser treatment for acne scars usually requires multiple sessions, as it may take several weeks or months to achieve optimal results. Your dermatologist will be able to provide you with an estimate of the number of sessions needed based on your specific condition.\n\n4. Pre-treatment preparation: Before undergoing laser treatment, it is important to follow any pre-treatment instructions provided by your dermatologist.

Did my tooth die? What are they checking for when they x-ray the tooth?\n\n### Response:Based on the information provided, it does not sound like your tooth died as a result of the trauma. When a tooth is cracked or fractured, it is possible for the nerve inside the tooth to become damaged or infected. However, this is not always the case.\n\nWhen dentists take x-rays of a tooth that has been previously treated for a fracture, they are primarily checking for any signs of further damage such as additional cracks or cavities that may have occurred since the initial treatment. They are also looking for any signs of infection or abscesses that may not be visible on the surface.\n\nIn your case, since you mentioned that you have had no problems with the tooth since the initial treatment and multiple x-rays have been taken, it seems like the tooth is stable and there are no ongoing issues. However, it is always important to maintain regular dental check-ups and follow-ups with your dentist to monitor the health of your teeth.",

Stress on the jaw from wearing braces can sometimes lead to TMJ disorders, which can result in ear ringing or tinnitus.\n\n2. Orthodontic-related issues: In some cases, the alignment of your teeth may have affected the position of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), leading to TMJ disorders.

Please help.\n\n### Response:Based on the information provided, it seems that you are experiencing an irregular heart rhythm, as indicated by the Holter test results. The pause of 1.8 seconds between beats is considered significant and may indicate atrial fibrillation.\n\nAtrial fibrillation is a common type of arrhythmia characterized by rapid and irregular electrical signals in the atria of the heart, causing them to quiver instead of contracting properly. This can lead to inefficient pumping of blood and an increased risk of stroke, heart failure, and other complications.\n\nGiven your age, history of bypass surgery, and symptoms of palpitations and occasional headaches, it is important to further evaluate and manage this condition. I recommend scheduling an appointment with a cardiologist who can conduct a thorough evaluation, including additional tests such as an electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiogram, to assess the structure and function of your heart.\n\nIn the meantime, it is important to monitor your symptoms closely and seek immediate medical attention if you experience any worsening symptoms, such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or fainting.\n\nPlease consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan tailored to your specific condition.",

The typical length of healing for viral conjunctivitis is usually around 7-10 days, but it can vary from person to person.\n\nRegarding protecting the healing eye from re-infection, it is important to avoid touching or rubbing your eyes, as this can spread the virus to the healing eye. Additionally, it is advisable to avoid close contact with individuals who have pink eye or wear disposable contact lenses to prevent cross-contamination.\n\nAs for the vision problems you mentioned, it is not uncommon for the vision to worsen during the healing process.

Therefore, it is possible that the blisters could be a result of sexual activity.\n\nI would recommend the patient to seek medical attention from a healthcare professional, such as a primary care physician or a sexually transmitted infection (STI) specialist. They will be able to provide a definitive diagnosis and discuss appropriate treatment options with the patient.\n\nIn the meantime, it is important for the patient to avoid sexual activity until they have been diagnosed and receive proper medical advice. This will help prevent the spread of any potential infections to partners."

The presence of multiple sclerosis (MS) or other demyelinating diseases should be considered, as these conditions can cause similar symptoms.\n\nThe neurologist's recommendation to take Ecosprin suggests that they suspect inflammation or an autoimmune process as a potential cause of the symptoms.\n\nHowever, based on the patient's description and the provided information, it is not possible to provide a definitive diagnosis or treatment plan without further evaluation and examination.

It involves injecting a small amount of fluid into the forearm and then evaluating the reaction after 48-72 hours.\n\nIn your case, as a former cigarette smoker, it is important to note that smoking can weaken the immune system and make you more susceptible to tuberculosis infection. However, it does not necessarily mean that you have been exposed to tuberculosis.\n\nBased on the images you provided, it appears that your skin test reaction is positive. A positive reaction indicates exposure to the tuberculosis bacteria, but it does not confirm active tuberculosis infection.\n\nTo further evaluate your situation, I recommend consulting with a healthcare professional who can conduct a thorough examination, review your medical history, and consider additional tests if necessary.\n\nPlease consult with a healthcare provider who can provide a comprehensive evaluation based on your specific circumstances.",

Night: Clozapex 25 mg half a pill, Mirtimash 30 g half a pill, Depakine Chrono 500 mg one pill, and Anafranil 75 mg half a pill.I used to take more but I stopped them over the past two years. For example, I used to take double the mentioned dose about nine months ago. I recovered from depression a couple of months ago. I started detoxing but with my doctor, the process was going way too slow and I have gained 45 kilograms over the past two years (25 in the past two months alone!) my muscles, my bones, and my joints started to hurt really bad because of my weight. Nothing works. I go to the gym every day, I workout but still I eat way too much because of the drugs and I cannot control it. My doctor does not want me to stop despite every hardship that I face and even refuses to decrease half a pill from the prescription. However, three weeks ago, I decided to cut all medications once and for all. I lost 7 kilograms, I stopped eating too much and just by cutting down the drugs I saved not less than 1800 calories per day. I started going to the gym more regularly. But here is the problem.Clozapex 25 and Mirtimash make me sleep and without them, I cannot sleep. No kidding, I have not slept in the past three weeks more than a maximum of 70 hours.

It can cause sores or ulcers on the surface of the tonsils, including the area at the back of the throat and the roof of the mouth.\n\nTonsillitis is often caused by a viral or bacterial infection, such as the common cold or flu. It can also be caused by a Streptococcus bacteria infection, known as strep throat.\n\nTo confirm the diagnosis and determine the appropriate treatment, I recommend visiting a healthcare professional who can examine your throat and possibly perform tests such as a throat swab to check for bacterial infection. They will provide you with the best course of action, which may include antibiotics if strep throat is suspected.",

In your mother's case, the presence of ischemic heart disease suggests that she may have atherosclerosis, which is caused by a buildup of plaque in the arteries. Treatment options may include lifestyle modifications such as adopting a heart-healthy diet, regular exercise, smoking cessation, and managing her diabetes and blood pressure.

It is important to note that I am an AI language model and not a doctor, so I cannot provide a definitive diagnosis. However, I can suggest some possibilities:\n\n1. Glandular swelling: The lump could be due to enlargement of a normal gland in your neck, such as the thyroid gland. This is a common cause of neck lumps and can sometimes be associated with symptoms like dry throat and warmth.\n\n2. Infection or inflammation: Another possibility is that the lump is caused by an infection or inflammation in the area, such as a viral or bacterial infection. These conditions can also cause symptoms like a dry throat and fever.\n\n3. Benign tumor: Although less common, it is possible that the lump is caused by a benign tumor. Benign tumors are non-cancerous growths that usually do not spread to other parts of the body.\n\n4. Other causes: There are other less likely possibilities, such as a cyst or abscess, but these are less common causes for a neck lump.\n\nTo determine the exact cause of your lump, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional.

It is important to consider the potential side effects and long-term implications of any medication.\n\nIn the case of personal dermatitis, antibiotics such as doxycycline are commonly prescribed to help control the bacterial infection that may be contributing to the symptoms.

Dry socket occurs when the blood clot that forms in the socket after tooth extraction gets dislodged or dissolves, leading to pain, swelling, and discomfort.\n\nTo determine if it is infected or dry socket, you should look for the following signs:\n\n1. Infection:\n- Increasing pain: If the pain is worsening despite the dentist's cleaning, it could indicate an infection.\n- Pus discharge: Look for a white or yellowish liquid coming from the extraction site.\n- Fever: If you develop a fever, it may suggest an infection.\n\n2. Dry socket:\n- Severe pain: Dry socket typically causes severe pain that is not relieved by painkillers.\n- Bad taste: You may experience a bad taste in your mouth due to the exposed nerves.\n- Nausea: Some individuals may experience nausea or vomiting.\n- Loss of blood clot: The blood clot may be lost, leading to increased pain and exposure of the bone and nerves.\n\nIt is important to contact your dentist as soon as possible to discuss your symptoms and receive appropriate treatment.

Sleep paralysis is a condition where a person feels temporarily unable to move or speak while waking up or falling asleep. It is often accompanied by a sense of anxiety or fear.\n\nThe fact that the patient experiences this jerking sensation only when they are about to fall asleep suggests that it may be related to the transition between wakefulness and sleep. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as \"hypnagogic jerk.\"\n\nIt is important to note that sleep paralysis can have various causes, including changes in sleep patterns, stress, anxiety, certain medications, sleep disorders, or even underlying medical conditions such as narcolepsy.\n\nTo further evaluate the cause of the patient's sleep paralysis, it would be advisable to conduct a thorough medical history review, including any recent changes in sleep patterns, stress levels, or medication use. Additionally, a physical examination and additional tests may be necessary to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to the symptoms.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that while sleep paralysis itself is not typically considered a serious medical condition, it can be distressing for some individuals.

Why we are getting frequent colds?2. What can be done to reduce the amount of colds we are getting?\n\n### Response:1. Frequent colds can be caused by various factors such as weakened immune system, exposure to viruses, poor hand hygiene, and living in close proximity to someone who has a cold. To reduce the frequency of colds, you can:\n   - Practice good hand hygiene by washing your hands regularly with soap and water or using hand sanitizer.\n   - Avoid close contact with individuals who have a cold or flu-like symptoms.\n   - Keep your environment clean and free from germs.\n   - Maintain a healthy lifestyle by getting enough sleep, eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly, and managing stress.\n   - Stay up to date with vaccinations, especially the flu vaccine.\n   - Avoid touching your face, especially your eyes, nose, and mouth, as this can transfer viruses from your hands to your respiratory system.\n\n2. To reduce the amount of colds you are getting, it is important to focus on prevention rather than just treating the symptoms.

The presence of a cyst and sinusitis on CBCT scan indicates that there is still infection present in the tooth.\n\nGiven your age and the presence of bone resorption in the upper left maxillary region, it would be advisable to consider extraction of the tooth rather than attempting another root canal treatment. Extraction will allow for complete removal of the infection and prevent further complications.\n\nAdditionally, since you have been diagnosed with Hashimoto thyroiditis, it is important to consider the potential impact of dental infections on your overall health. Infections can worsen thyroid function and contribute to inflammation, so it is crucial to address this issue.\n\nTherefore, I recommend considering extraction of the tooth rather than pursuing another root canal treatment.

Molluscum contagiosum: Molluscum contagiosum is a viral infection that commonly affects the skin and can cause small, round, raised bumps.

They are usually harmless and can occur anywhere on the body, including the genital area. Removing a skin tag typically involves surgical removal or physical removal through techniques like cauterization or ligation. Since the skin tag came back after three months, it may be worth considering other factors that could contribute to its recurrence, such as friction or irritation in the area.\n\n3.

Please suggest some medicines without side effects.\n\n### Response:Hello,\n\nI understand your concerns about low sexual drive and the dry and insensitive penis. As a doctor, I can provide you with some information and suggestions.\n\n1. Medications to induce sexual desire:\nThere are several medications available that can help increase sexual desire in both men and women. However, it is important to note that the use of medication should be discussed with a healthcare professional, as they can evaluate your specific condition and determine the most appropriate treatment option. Some commonly prescribed medications for low sexual desire include:\n\n- Flibanserin: This medication is specifically approved for pre-menopausal women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD).\n- Testosterone replacement therapy: This may be considered for men with low testosterone levels, but it should only be prescribed by a healthcare professional experienced in hormone replacement therapy.\n\n2. Topical creams for penile sensitivity:\nThere are various topical creams available that claim to enhance penile sensitivity. However, it is important to be cautious when using these products as they may not be regulated by health authorities. Some commonly used topical creams include:\n\n- L-arginine cream: L-arginine is an amino acid that plays a role in the production of nitric oxide, which helps relax blood vessels.",

Based on your description, it seems like Trazadone may not be effectively helping you sleep.\n\nInsomnia can have various causes, including stress, anxiety, certain medications, or underlying medical conditions. To determine the cause of your insomnia, it would be best to consult with your primary care physician (GP). They will be able to evaluate your symptoms, medical history, and perform any necessary tests to identify the underlying cause.\n\nIn the meantime, there are some strategies you can try to help improve your sleep:\n\n1. Stick to a consistent sleep schedule: Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends.\n2. Create a relaxing bedtime routine: Engage in activities that help you unwind and relax before bed, such as reading a book, taking a warm bath, or practicing relaxation techniques like deep breathing or meditation.\n3. Make your bedroom conducive to sleep: Ensure your bedroom is cool, quiet, dark, and free from distractions. Use earplugs, eye shades, or a white noise machine if needed.\n4. Limit exposure to electronic devices before bed: The blue light emitted by smartphones, tablets, and computers can interf",

We are confused and worried if she is pregnant. She has PCOD also. She had her last periods 45 days back. Do we have to go for a blood test?\n\n### Response:Based on the patient's description, it is possible that she may be experiencing early signs of pregnancy even though her home pregnancy test came negative. The symptoms she is experiencing, such as vomiting sensation, inability to eat, stomach cramps, and light fever, can be associated with early pregnancy.\n\nHowever, it is important to rule out other possibilities as well. Given her history of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOD) and irregular periods, it would be prudent to consider other causes for her symptoms.\n\nTo further evaluate her condition, I would recommend that she undergo a blood test to check her hormone levels, specifically human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and progesterone. Elevated levels of hCG can indicate early pregnancy, while elevated levels of progesterone can suggest a possible pregnancy or other conditions.\n\nIt is also worth noting that a blood test can provide more accurate results compared to a home pregnancy test, especially in cases where there is a question of early pregnancy or when other factors, such as hormonal imbalances or medications, may interfere with the reliability of a urine-based test.\n\nTherefore, I would advise the patient to consult with a healthcare professional who can perform a thorough evaluation",

Here are some possible explanations for the elevated albumin levels:\n\n1. Chronic liver disease: The presence of fatty liver and cystitis on ultrasound suggests a possible chronic liver disease. Fatty liver can lead to impaired liver function and decreased albumin production.\n\n2. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): The variation in albumin levels from 55 to 37.5 mg/g suggests impaired kidney function. CKD can result in decreased albumin production due to damaged nephrons.\n\n3. Diabetes: The patient has a history of diabetes for more than two years and a current HbA1c level of 5.5, indicating poor glycemic control. Diabetes can cause hypoalbuminemia as a result of chronic inflammation and increased urinary excretion of albumin.\n\n4.

So, I thought I would consult with you on another question pertaining to my son. Unfortunately, a combination of my health anxiety and the big mistake of searching online has my mind imagining the worst with regard to my son. My son is 19 years old and has no diagnosed medical issues. I noticed back when he was about eight or ten years old that he had a mark resembling a cafe au lait mark on his back, in the upper shoulder area. I had always asked the pediatrician to look at it during his yearly physicals, and they made nothing of it. Throughout the years it has grown a bit and has become darker and more rough in texture. It is probably slightly less than an inch in length and looks like a few small lesions grouped together. Again, I have brought it to the pediatrician\\s attention and he was not concerned. Three months ago, I made an appointment for him and my other son with a dermatologist for a skin exam, and I pointed out the spots which I wanted to be checked in particular. We met with the physician\\s assistant there, and my younger son had a peculiar spot I pointed out, of which the PA conducted a shave biopsy, which came back as a mildly atypical junctional nevus. For my older son, I pointed out the spot on his back/shoulder, and the PA diagnosed it as a linear epidermal nevus. She said the chances of it becoming dangerous are slim to none. It may darken throughout the years, and they will simply monitor it at yearly visits. Unfortunately, I went on to research online about epidermal nevi and of course I ran into information showing a possible link to epidermal nevus syndrome and all of its associated neurological and skeletal defects. As I said, he is 19 and has no medical issues, is extremely intelligent, etc. In your opinion, is it safe to say that I should not be concerned about those syndromes? I presume it is primarily related to the numerous and systemic epidermal nevi, which he does not have, and I would think it would have presented by now? And my last even more neurotic question. My online research led me to some information saying that a certain type of epidermal nevus could be related to a gene mutation that could be passed along to an offspring, with them having possible serious skin scaling conditions, etc. Again, he has just one solitary small epidermal nevus. No biopsy was done, as the PA did not feel it was necessary. Do you feel there is any need for me to worry about that potential genetic mutation? Thank you so much for reading my long query.",

Thank you so much for reading my long query.\n\n### Response:Hello,\n\nThank you for reaching out and sharing your concerns. I understand your worries as a parent. It's important to address your questions and provide reassurance.\n\nFirstly, epidermal nevi are common benign skin lesions that occur when pigment cells are born prematurely in the outer layer of the skin (epidermis). They typically do not pose any health risks and are usually harmless. The majority of epidermal nevi do not progress or change over time.\n\nIn your case, the dermatologist's PA diagnosed your son's linear epidermal nevus as \"mildly atypical.\" This means that there may be some variation in the appearance of the nevus compared to typical ones. However, it does not indicate any increased risk or association with other conditions.\n\nRegarding the chances of it becoming dangerous, it is important to note that epidermal nevi are not known to transform into cancerous lesions. The risk of malignant transformation is extremely low.\n\nAs for the potential genetic mutation and its impact on your son's future offspring, it is essential to consider that epidermal nevus syndrome is a rare condition characterized by multiple atypical epidermal nevi and associated systemic abnormalities. In most cases, it is not inherited but occurs",

Then I found white thick stuff at the back of my tongue. Is it candida?\n\n### Response:Based on the symptoms you described, it is possible that you have a condition called oral thrush. Oral thrush is a fungal infection caused by Candida yeast, which is normally present in small amounts in the mouth. The white thick stuff at the back of your tongue could be the accumulation of this yeast.\n\nTo confirm the diagnosis and determine the best treatment plan, I recommend visiting a healthcare professional who can perform a physical examination and possibly a fungal culture of the affected area. They may also ask about your medical history and any other symptoms you may be experiencing.\n\nIn the meantime, you can try some self-care measures to alleviate the symptoms. Gently brushing your teeth and tongue with a soft toothbrush and using an antimicrobial mouthwash may help reduce the yeast population. Avoid sharing utensils, cups, or toothbrushes with others, as this can contribute to the spread of the infection.\n\nIt's important to note that unprotected sex with a partner who has a vaginal yeast infection can increase your risk of contracting oral thrush. To prevent future infections, it is recommended to practice safe sex by using barrier methods such as condoms.\n\nPlease consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.",

However, it is important to note that the absence of stenosis, sclerosis, or plaque in the arterial Doppler ultrasound suggests that peripheral artery disease (PAD) is less likely.\n\nThe patient's symptoms of pain in the buttocks and sciatic-like pain in the left leg, along with the cold foot and lower leg at night, are suggestive of a possible deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE). These symptoms may indicate the presence of a blood clot in the veins, which could potentially lead to complications if left untreated.\n\nTo further evaluate the possibility of a blood clot, a D-dimer test is commonly used. The D-dimer measures the level of fibrin degradation products in the blood, which can indicate the presence of a clot. If the D-dimer result is positive, it suggests the possibility of a clot, but it does not confirm the diagnosis.\n\nIn this case, the D-dimer result was negative,",

This infection can lead to inflammation and swelling in the surrounding tissues, including the cheek. The pain shooting down to the tooth is a common symptom of an abscessed tooth.\n\nIt is important for the patient to seek immediate dental attention as an abscessed tooth can cause further complications if left untreated. The dentist will need to perform a thorough examination and possibly drain the abscess to alleviate the pain and prevent any further spread of infection.\n\nPlease note that I am an AI language model and cannot provide a diagnosis or treatment plan.

The inward turn in her right eye after concentrating could be a sign of astigmatism, which is a common condition that can be corrected with glasses.\n\nThe results of her eye test indicate that she is long sighted (hyperopia) in both eyes, with a difference in cylindrical power between the two eyes. This means that her right eye has a higher cylindrical power than her left eye.\n\nGiven your family history of squints and glasses, it would be prudent to seek a second opinion from another eye care professional to confirm the diagnosis and ensure that the prescribed glasses are appropriate for your daughter's needs.",

These symptoms can be indicative of several possible conditions.\n\nOne possibility is that your baby may have lactose intolerance or an intolerance to certain components in the formula milk. Lactose intolerance occurs when the body is unable to fully digest lactose, a sugar found in milk and dairy products. This can lead to bloating, gas, and diarrhea.\n\nAnother possibility is that your baby may have gastroesophageal reflux (GER), also known as acid reflux. GER occurs when stomach acid flows back into the esophagus, causing discomfort and sometimes vomiting. It is common in infants and can often be managed with dietary changes and medications prescribed by a pediatrician.\n\nConstipation can also contribute to your baby's symptoms.

Are all lung scars progressive?\n\n### Response:Hello,\n\nI understand your concerns about the streakiness seen on your lower left lung on the X-ray. It is important to note that without further evaluation and diagnostic tests, it is difficult to determine the exact cause of the streakiness.\n\nIn general, not all lung scars are progressive. However, some lung scars can be associated with a condition called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), which is a chronic and progressive lung disease. IPF causes the formation of scar tissue in the lungs, leading to difficulty breathing and other symptoms.\n\nTo address your concerns, I would recommend scheduling an appointment with a pulmonologist who specializes in lung diseases. They will be able to evaluate your symptoms, medical history, and perform additional tests if necessary. These tests may include a high-resolution CT scan of the chest, pulmonary function tests, and possibly a bronchoscopy.\n\nBased on the results of these tests, the pulmonologist will be able to provide a more accurate diagnosis and determine if the small scar area is indeed non-progressive or if further evaluation is needed.

        "response": "Hello,\n\nI understand your concerns about the streakiness seen on your lower left lung on the X-ray. It is important to note that without further evaluation and diagnostic tests, it is difficult to determine the exact cause of the streakiness.\n\nIn general, not all lung scars are progressive. However, some lung scars can be associated with a condition called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), which is a chronic and progressive lung disease. IPF causes the formation of scar tissue in the lungs, leading to difficulty breathing and other symptoms.\n\nTo address your concerns, I would recommend scheduling an appointment with a pulmonologist who specializes in lung diseases. They will be able to evaluate your symptoms, medical history, and perform additional tests if necessary. These tests may include a high-resolution CT scan of the chest, pulmonary function tests, and possibly a bronchoscopy.\n\nBased on the results of these tests, the pulmonologist will be able to provide a more accurate diagnosis and determine if the small scar area is indeed non-progressive or if further evaluation is needed. It's important to seek medical advice from a qualified healthcare professional to get a proper evaluation and guidance.\n\nPlease remember that I am an AI language model and cannot provide a diagnosis or medical advice.

The symptoms you mentioned, such as difficulty urinating, bad premature ejaculation, and frequent nocturnal emissions, could be indicative of urethral stricture or damage to the smooth muscles in the corpus spongiosum or tunica albuginea.\n\nTo confirm the diagnosis and determine the extent of the damage, an MRI would be recommended.

The choice of surgical intervention depends on factors such as the severity of the stricture, the presence of strictures at different levels, and the overall health of the patient. Some common surgical options for urethral strictures include:\n\n1.

The symptoms you mentioned, such as difficulty urinating, bad premature ejaculation, and frequent nocturnal emissions, could be indicative of urethral stricture or damage to the smooth muscles in the corpus spongiosum or tunica albuginea.\n\nTo confirm the diagnosis and determine the extent of the damage, an MRI would be recommended. This imaging test can provide detailed images of the urethra and help identify any structural abnormalities or scar tissue formation.\n\nIn terms of surgical options, if there is a confirmed urethral stricture or significant damage to the urethral tissues, a variety of procedures may be considered. The choice of surgical intervention depends on factors such as the severity of the stricture, the presence of strictures at different levels, and the overall health of the patient. Some common surgical options for urethral strictures include:\n\n1. Urethroplasty: This involves widening the narrowed portion of the urethra using different techniques, such as excision of scar tissue or grafting.\n\n2.

But the gum is higher up than it is in any other teeth in my mouth. What caused this?

I would recommend scheduling an appointment with a dentist who can assess your specific situation and provide appropriate treatment options. They may suggest non-surgical procedures such as scaling and root planing to treat any underlying gum disease, followed by gum grafting surgery to cover the exposed tooth roots and restore the natural contour of your gums.\n\nIn the meantime, you can practice good oral hygiene by brushing and flossing regularly, using a soft-bristled toothbrush, and avoiding aggressive toothbrushing techniques. If you notice any signs of gum disease, such as redness, swelling, or bleeding gums, it's important to seek professional help promptly.",

Sperm can survive inside the vagina for up to 5 days, so there is a small chance of pregnancy even if he did not ejaculate.\n\nTo further assess your risk of pregnancy, I would recommend taking a home pregnancy test. If the test result is positive, it would confirm pregnancy. If the test result is negative, it would provide reassurance.\n\nTo avoid pregnancy in the future, it is recommended to use barrier methods such as condoms or diaphragms during sexual intercourse. Additionally, you can consider using hormonal contraceptives like birth control pills or an intrauterine device (IUD) after consulting with a healthcare professional.",

This can be concerning, but it is important to evaluate the situation further before jumping to any conclusions.\n\nTo determine if your baby is failing to thrive (FTT), we need to consider her growth pattern in relation to her age and weight. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines FTT as a weight loss or inadequate weight gain that is of concern for the child's growth and development.\n\nIn this case, your baby's weight gain has been relatively stable until the 120th day appointment, where there was a slight increase in weight. However, it is concerning that she has not been gaining weight consistently since the 90th day.\n\nTo address your concerns about your baby's weight gain, I would recommend consulting with your pediatrician or a pediatric specialist. They will be able to evaluate your baby's growth pattern in more detail and provide appropriate guidance.\n\nAs for the long-term effects of slow weight gain, it is important to note that each child is unique and may respond differently to different growth patterns. However, consistently slow weight gain can be associated with certain medical conditions or nutritional deficiencies. It is crucial to identify the underlying cause and address it promptly to ensure your baby's overall growth and development.",

I'll do my best to provide you with accurate and reliable information.\n\n1. Abortion Options:\nMedical abortion involves the use of medications to end a pregnancy. It is typically done during the early stages of pregnancy, usually up to around 9 weeks. The most commonly used medication for medical abortion is mifepristone (also known as RU-486) combined with another medication called misoprostol. This combination causes the uterus to contract and expel the pregnancy tissue.\n\nSurgical abortion, also known as abortion by aspiration or vacuum curettage, is performed during the later stages of pregnancy, usually after 12 weeks. A surgical procedure is performed to remove the pregnancy tissue from the uterus using instruments.\n\nIt's important to note that the availability and legality of abortion procedures may vary depending on your country and local laws. It's always best to consult with a healthcare professional in your area for specific information regarding abortion options in your particular situation.\n\n2.

The low libido for the past six years suggests a possible underlying issue.\n\nThe fact that most medications, including UpHold, Caverta, Pengra with or without depressant Prodep, have not helped suggests that there may be an underlying cause for their ED and PE that is not related to psychological factors.\n\nConsidering the patient's blood report, their FSH, LH, Serotonin, and Estradiol levels are below normal, while Testosterone and Dopamine levels are within the normal range.

I will do my best to help you with your questions.\n\n1. Are HIV 1 and 2 with p24 duo test after 28 days window period conclusive?\nThe HIV 1 and 2 p24 antigen test is typically performed as a part of a comprehensive STD screening panel, such as the TORCH test. The window period for this test is typically 28 days. During the window period, it is possible to have acquired the infection but still test negative. Therefore, a negative result during the 28-day window period does not rule out the possibility of recent HIV infection. It is important to consider other risk factors and repeat the test after the appropriate time frame has passed to confirm the result.\n\n2. I got a positive result for rubella. CMV and HSV 1 and 2 IgG positive but IgM negative. Am I an eligible person for marriage and sexual relationship?\nBased on the information provided, a positive result for rubella indicates exposure to the virus. However, the presence of CMV and HSV 1 and 2 IgG antibodies indicates previous infection without current active infection. The absence of IgM antibodies suggests that you are currently not infected with these viruses. Therefore, it",

My son, who is 10 years old, also plays badminton and seemed to have milder tennis elbow. Do you like to give any suggestions for him? Thanks.\n\n### Response:For your tennis elbow, I would recommend the following precautions and exercises to help with the healing process:\n\n1. Rest: Give your arm a break from activities that aggravate the pain. Avoid playing badminton or any other repetitive motions that may worsen the condition.\n\n2. Ice: Applying ice to the affected area for 15-20 minutes several times a day can help reduce inflammation and alleviate pain. Make sure to wrap the ice pack in a thin towel before applying it directly to your skin.\n\n3. Stretching and strengthening exercises: Performing specific exercises for your forearm, wrist, and hand can help improve flexibility and strengthen the muscles supporting your elbow. Some examples include:\n   - Wrist flexor stretch: Extend your arm in front of you with your palm facing upwards. Bend your wrist downward, feeling a stretch in the back of your hand. Hold for 15-30 seconds and repeat 3-4 times.\n   - Wrist extensor stretch: Extend your arm in front of you with your palm facing downwards. Bend your wrist upward, feeling a stretch in the back of your hand. Hold for 15-30 seconds and repeat 3-4 times.\n   - Fore",

However, the exact effect of Ecstasy on the effectiveness of NorLevo is not well-established.\n\nIf a female has taken Ecstasy and then takes NorLevo within 72 hours afterward, there may be a lower chance of pregnancy occurring compared to if she had not taken Ecstasy.

Since you mentioned that there was no fresh air or light in the room, it is unlikely that the soap or any other facility in the bathroom was contaminated with blood or semen.\n3. The fact that you do not recall any small wounds on your penis or hands suggests that there was no direct physical contact with infected fluids.\n4. As a virgin, your lack of sexual activity reduces the likelihood of exposure to HIV through sexual intercourse.\n\nConsidering these factors, the probability of acquiring HIV in this scenario is relatively low. However, it is still advisable to take precautionary measures and get tested for HIV as a precautionary measure. It is recommended to visit a healthcare professional who can provide you with proper guidance and perform an HIV test. They will be able to assess your individual risk factors and provide appropriate advice based on"

A dermatologist recommended me to try dermaroller so I want to know is it safe? And will it work? Please explain in detail as nothing has worked for me.\n\n### Response:As a doctor, I would need more information about your specific condition and medical history to provide a proper recommendation. However, I can give you some general information.\n\nUsing steroid cream, such as Betnovate-C, can have several side effects, including thinning of the skin and darkening of the skin. This is because steroids can suppress the production of melanin, which leads to increased pigmentation and potentially darkening of the skin.\n\nUsing a dermaroller is generally safe when performed by a trained professional. It involves rolling a device with multiple needles over the skin to promote collagen production and improve fine lines and scars. However, it is important to note that dermarollers can potentially cause skin damage, including thinning of the skin, and may not be suitable for everyone, especially those with sensitive skin or certain medical conditions.\n\nIt is recommended to consult with a dermatologist who can assess your specific condition and provide personalized advice. They will be able to evaluate your skin condition, discuss the potential risks and benefits of using a dermaroller, and recommend alternative treatments if necessary.",

I recently began to experience pain around my eyes on the left side. I use to work on the computer for 8 hours a day. What medicine can I use that will cure the redness?\n\n### Response:Based on the symptoms you described, it appears that you are experiencing dry eye syndrome. Tetryzoline may not have had an effect on the redness because it primarily works to constrict blood vessels and reduce swelling.\n\nFor the redness, dryness, itching, and grittiness in your eyes, I would recommend using artificial tears or lubricating eye drops. These can help relieve the symptoms of dry eye and provide relief for your discomfort.\n\nIn addition to using eye drops, it is important to address the underlying cause of your symptoms. If you have been working on a computer for 8 hours a day, it is possible that prolonged screen time has contributed to your dry eye symptoms. To alleviate the pain around your eyes on the left side, you may consider taking a break from your computer every 20 minutes and focusing on tasks that do not require visual concentration.\n\nIf your symptoms persist or worsen despite using artificial tears and making lifestyle changes, I would recommend consulting with an ophthalmologist for further evaluation and potential prescription medications to address the underlying cause of your dry eye syndrome.",

This can sometimes occur as your body adjusts to the hormonal changes caused by the contraceptive.\n\nTo ensure proper contraception, it is recommended to continue taking the tablet regularly until you complete the pack, even if your period has not started properly.

This will help protect against any potential risks of pregnancy.\n\nIn terms of starting a new pack on the first day of every period, this is not necessary unless advised by your doctor. Typically, Femilon tablets are prescribed to be taken daily for continuous protection against pregnancy. However, if you prefer to have a regular schedule, you can choose to start a new pack on the first day of your menstrual cycle.\n\nIt is always best to consult with your healthcare provider for personalized advice regarding your specific situation. They will be able to provide you with the most accurate guidance based on your medical history and individual needs."

Of note, she is currently on Lasix and Aldactone.\n\n### Response:I'm sorry to hear about your child's diagnosis. Tetralogy of Fallot is a congenital heart defect that affects the structure of the heart and its ability to pump blood effectively. The survival rate for infants with tetralogy of Fallot can vary depending on various factors, including the severity of the condition and the presence of any other underlying health issues.\n\nIn general, the survival rate for infants with tetralogy of Fallot is relatively low, with most infants requiring surgical intervention within the first few months of life. However, it's important to note that each case is unique, and the prognosis can vary significantly.\n\nIn your case, since your child has been diagnosed with tetralogy of Fallot and is currently on medications such as Lasix and Aldactone, it is likely that she will require surgical intervention in the near future. These medications are commonly prescribed to help manage the symptoms associated with tetralogy of Fallot and improve the overall function of the heart.\n\nI would recommend discussing your concerns and questions about your child's condition with your cardiologist.

With being a severe asthmatic.\n\n### Response:As a doctor, I can provide some information on your concerns.\n\n1. Scoliosis and posture: Scoliosis is a condition characterized by an abnormal curvature of the spine. It can cause postural issues such as uneven shoulders, rib cage prominence, and a shift in the hips or waist. However, it is important to note that scoliosis itself does not directly cause pain. Pain may be present if there are associated conditions like muscle imbalances, joint dysfunctions, or nerve compression.\n\n2. Left knee arthroscopy and posture: A left knee arthroscopy is a surgical procedure used to diagnose and treat certain knee conditions. While it is possible for this surgery to affect posture temporarily due to changes in leg length or muscle weakness, it is not typically the primary cause of long-term postural issues.\n\n3. Blood clots and scoliosis: Scoliosis itself does not increase the risk of blood clots. However, individuals with certain medical conditions, such as immobility due to surgery or prolonged bed rest, may have an increased risk of developing blood clots. As a severe asthmatic, it is important to discuss your medical history and current medications with your surgeon or orthopedic specialist to assess any additional risks",

The continuous cough for one hour could be due to worsening of the condition. The drop in SpO2 to around 86 indicates that the baby is having difficulty breathing and may require supplemental oxygen support.\n\nIt is not uncommon for premature babies, especially those who were primarily formula fed, to develop respiratory issues such as bronchiolitis. Bronchiolitis is usually caused by a viral infection and can lead to inflammation and congestion of the small airways in the lungs.\n\nI would recommend continuing the nebulizer treatment with Asthalin huf puf as prescribed by the doctor. Nebulizer therapy helps to deliver medication directly to the lungs and can provide relief for symptoms such as cough and wheezing associated with bronchiolitis.\n\nIf the baby's condition does not improve or worsens further, it is important to seek immediate medical attention.

The drop in SpO2 to around 86 indicates that the baby is having difficulty breathing and may require supplemental oxygen support.\n\nIt is not uncommon for premature babies, especially those who were primarily formula fed, to develop respiratory issues such as bronchiolitis. Bronchiolitis is usually caused by a viral infection and can lead to inflammation and congestion of the small airways in the lungs.\n\nI would recommend continuing the nebulizer treatment with Asthalin huf puf as prescribed by the doctor. Nebulizer therapy helps to deliver medication directly to the lungs and can provide relief for symptoms such as cough and wheezing associated with bronchiolitis.\n\nIf the baby's condition does not improve or worsens further, it is important to seek immediate medical attention. The healthcare team will assess the baby's condition and may need to adjust the treatment plan accordingly."

Occasionally, when I interact with animals, I have a reaction but it is difficult to determine whether it is actually the pollen which I am highly allergic to.\n\n### Response:Skin prick tests are considered highly accurate in predicting positive reactions to allergens. They are commonly used to diagnose allergies and determine which substances a person is allergic to. In the case of pet dander, a negative skin prick test result usually indicates that there is no immediate allergic reaction to the specific allergen present in pet dander.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that even with negative skin prick test results, some individuals may still experience allergic reactions to pet dander. This can vary from person to person and may depend on various factors such as the individual's immune system, previous exposure to pets, and the specific type of pet involved.\n\nIf you are concerned about potential allergic reactions to pet dander, it is recommended to consult with an allergist or immunologist who can further evaluate your specific situation. They may suggest additional diagnostic tests, such as blood work or specific IgE testing, to confirm your allergy status and provide personalized guidance regarding pet ownership.",

Since then, I have had spotting daily, some days heavier than others, but very frequent. I also have been experiencing mild cramping and bleeding after intercourse. Is this a dangerous condition?\n\n### Response:Based on the information provided, it seems that you are experiencing some side effects of the Skyla IUD. The heavy and painful period after insertion is known as \"initial implantation bleeding\" and is expected with the use of this type of contraception. However, the ongoing spotting, mild cramping, and intercourse-related bleeding could indicate an underlying issue.\n\nIt is important to note that the Skyla IUD is a highly effective form of birth control, but it may not be suitable for everyone. Some potential complications include:\n\n1. Perforation: The risk of the IUD perforating the uterus is relatively low but exists. Symptoms may include abdominal pain, heavy bleeding, and fever.\n\n2. Expulsion: The IUD may become dislodged from its position in the uterus. This can occur due to factors such as weight gain or loss, exercise, or vaginal pressure during intercourse.\n\n3. Infection: There is a small risk of infection at the site where the IUD is inserted. Symptoms may include pelvic pain, fever, and abnormal vaginal discharge.\n\n4. Menstrual irregularities: Some women may experience irregular or prolonged menstrual bleeding after insertion of the IUD.\n\nConsidering your symptoms",

I was wondering if you could help me understand the process more. Thank you.\n\n### Response:As a doctor, I can provide some information about the procedure you mentioned, frenectomy, and its potential impact on orthodontic treatment.\n\nA frenectomy is a surgical procedure that involves removing or repositioning the frenum, which is a small muscle or tissue that connects different parts of the mouth. In your case, it is likely that the frenum is causing the gap between your two front teeth.\n\nFollowing a frenectomy, there may be some temporary changes in the position of your teeth, which could potentially affect the alignment of your bite. This can sometimes lead to an increased space between your teeth, making it appear larger.\n\nIn such cases, orthodontic treatment, such as braces, may be recommended to address the changes in tooth position and align your teeth properly. The goal of orthodontic treatment is to ensure that your teeth function properly and look aesthetically pleasing.\n\nIt is important to discuss your concerns with both your dentist and orthodontist to understand their perspectives and make an informed decision based on your specific situation. They will be able to provide you with personalized recommendations and explain the reasons behind their recommendations.\n\nI hope this helps clarify the process for you.",

It involves applying a force to the knee while it is bent at 30 degrees and examining for any give or instability.\n\nIn your case, the positive Lelli test with good leverage suggests that there may be a partial tear or re-injury to your ACL. However, it is important to note that the Lelli test alone cannot definitively diagnose a complete ACL rupture.\n\nTo confirm the diagnosis, additional tests such as the Lachman test and/or an MRI may be necessary. The Lachman test assesses the stability of the knee by measuring the amount of forward movement of the tibia (shinbone) relative to the femur (thighbone) during knee extension.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that the accuracy of the Lelli test may vary depending on the individual and the skill of the healthcare provider performing the test. Therefore, it is recommended to consult with your surgeon and physiotherapist for a comprehensive evaluation and further management.",

Remember to avoid harsh soaps and scrubbing, as this can further irritate the skin.\n\nIt's important to note that if your acne persists or worsens, it's advisable to consult with a dermatologist who can provide a personalized treatment plan based on your specific needs."

In the last six months, I had three urine testings with the account of cortisol between 10-12 \\xb5g/24 hours. I am dealing with PTSD and a distinct fatigue.\n\n### Response:The normal range of cortisol in a 24-hour collected urine probe is typically between 50-250 \\xb5g/24 hours. Having low cortisol levels in a 24-hour collected urine probe can be a clinical matter, especially if it is significantly below the normal range.

Phimosis is the narrowing of the opening of the penis, which can make it difficult for urine to flow out freely.\n\nThe fact that the foreskin at the bottom part is quite flexible but attached to the inner meatus at the tip suggests a condition called paraphimosis, where the foreskin gets retracted back to the point of being unable to be fully returned to its original position. This can lead to pain, swelling, and urinary problems.\n\nThe improvement in ballooning after applying a corticosteroid cream is a positive sign, as this medication can help reduce inflammation and relieve symptoms. However, the persistent narrow opening is concerning and may require further evaluation and treatment.\n\nI would recommend scheduling an appointment with a pediatrician or a urologist to assess your son's condition. They will be able to provide a proper diagnosis and suggest appropriate treatment options, which may include topical medications, circumcision, or other interventions depending on the severity of the condition.\n\nPlease consult with a healthcare professional for a definitive diagnosis and appropriate management plan.",

Medications: The inhaler you mentioned for asthma may contain corticosteroids, which can cause weight gain and difficulty losing fat. Nasal sprays may also contain steroids, which can contribute to weight gain. Additionally, thyroxine medication for thyroid can also affect metabolism and lead to weight gain.\n\n2. Thyroid dysfunction: Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) can slow down metabolism, making it difficult to lose weight, even with exercise and a healthy diet. It is important to get your thyroid function tested to rule out this possibility.\n\n3. Insulin resistance: Certain medications like inhalers and nasal sprays can increase insulin resistance, making it harder for your body to use glucose for energy and leading to weight gain.\n\n4. Allergies and allergic rhinitis: Nasal sprays used for allergies can cause fluid retention and inflammation in the nasal passages, which can contribute to weight gain.\n\n5.

It is important to consider other factors such as medications, underlying medical conditions, and hormonal imbalances.\n\n1. Medications: The inhaler you mentioned for asthma may contain corticosteroids, which can cause weight gain and difficulty losing fat. Nasal sprays may also contain steroids, which can contribute to weight gain. Additionally, thyroxine medication for thyroid can also affect metabolism and lead to weight gain.\n\n2. Thyroid dysfunction: Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) can slow down metabolism, making it difficult to lose weight, even with exercise and a healthy diet. It is important to get your thyroid function tested to rule out this possibility.\n\n3. Insulin resistance: Certain medications like inhalers and nasal sprays can increase insulin resistance, making it harder for your body to use glucose for energy and leading to weight gain.\n\n4. Allergies and allergic rhinitis: Nasal sprays used for allergies can cause fluid retention and inflammation in the nasal passages, which can contribute to weight gain.\n\n5.

Now i want to ask can ear drops cure inner infection too if i keep taking my drops. Dexatob/Clotrim\n\n### Response:As a doctor, I can provide some information on your question. \n\nEar drops can help treat external ear infections by targeting bacteria or fungi that are causing the infection. However, they do not have direct access to the inner ear or the infection within the inner ear walls.\n\nIn cases of chronic ear infections that keep recurring despite treatment with ear drops, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional, such as an otolaryngologist (ear, nose, and throat specialist), who can evaluate the condition and determine the appropriate course of treatment.\n\nIn some cases, if the infection is severe or persistent, oral antibiotics or other systemic medications may be prescribed to target the underlying infection. Additionally, other treatment options such as pain relievers, wound care, and drainage of any fluid or pus from the ear may be recommended.\n\nIt is crucial to follow the instructions provided by your healthcare provider and complete the full course of treatment to ensure effective management of the infection.",

Brush teeth regularly: Start brushing your baby's teeth twice a day using a soft-bristled toothbrush and fluoride toothpaste. Make sure to clean all surfaces of the teeth, including the front ones.\n\n3. Use fluoride products: Consider using fluoride toothpaste or gel, especially for bedtime brushing. Fluoride helps to strengthen the teeth and prevent decay.\n\n4.

Is it true? Are they out of my system or will it take years to appear if they caused me cancer?\n\n### Response:As a doctor, I cannot provide a direct answer without further information or conducting tests. However, I can provide some general information.\n\nThe use of self-tanning creams has been associated with an increased risk of skin cancer, particularly melanoma. However, it is important to note that the majority of cases of skin cancer are caused by excessive exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun or tanning beds, rather than the use of self-tanning creams alone.\n\nIf you have stopped using self-tanning creams for the past two years and do not have any other risk factors for skin cancer, it is possible that the creams may no longer be in your system. However, it is always recommended to consult with a healthcare professional for a thorough evaluation and to discuss any concerns you may have.\n\nIt is important to remember that self-tanning creams can still contain harmful ingredients even if they are not actively used. It may take several years for any potential cancer-causing effects to manifest. Regular skin checks and early detection are crucial in detecting any abnormalities.\n\nI would strongly encourage you to schedule an appointment with a dermatologist who can assess your individual situation and provide personalized advice based on your medical history and current health status.",

The fact that they had a previous episode of common cold symptoms that resolved completely suggests that this is not a new infection.\n\nThe patient's symptoms include a runny nose, sore throat, and mild body aches.

The fact that the symptoms resolved completely in the previous episode suggests that it was a self-limiting illness.\n\nThe patient mentions that they took a cetirizine tablet on the same day the symptoms started in both episodes, but the medicine did not work. Cetirizine is an antihistamine commonly used to relieve symptoms of allergies and the common cold, including sneezing, runny nose, and itching. However, it does not directly treat the underlying viral infection.\n\nRegarding the possible HIV exposure, it is important to note that the chances of HIV infection from a possible exposure are quite low unless there was a significant risk factor involved, such as unprotected sexual intercourse or sharing needles.

Cetirizine is an antihistamine commonly used to relieve symptoms of allergies and the common cold, including sneezing, runny nose, and itching. However, it does not directly treat the underlying viral infection.\n\nRegarding the possible HIV exposure, it is important to note that the chances of HIV infection from a possible exposure are quite low unless there was a significant risk factor involved, such as unprotected sexual intercourse or sharing needles. Even if the patient had been exposed to HIV, it would not explain why the cetirizine did not work in this particular episode.\n\nIn conclusion, based on"

The symptoms of excessive urination and burning sensation during sexual intercourse could be related to the recurrence of the infection.\n\nThe initial treatment with Itraconazole 200 mg for five days and Lulifin cream was likely effective in clearing the initial infection. However, since the symptoms have recurred, it suggests that the infection might not have been completely eradicated.\n\nIn such cases, it is advisable to restart the treatment with the Oxra tablet. The patient should consult their healthcare provider to discuss the appropriate dosage and duration of the Oxra tablet treatment. It is important to follow the healthcare provider's instructions carefully and complete the full course of treatment to ensure complete eradication of the infection.\n\nAdditionally, it is recommended to continue using the Lulifin cream as a preventive measure to reduce the risk of future infections.\n\nIt is worth noting that Carbophage G 1 is used for diabetes management and does not directly treat the fungal infection on the penis.",

Have a thorough examination of the ear by a healthcare professional, such as an otolaryngologist (ear, nose, and throat specialist).\n2. Perform a tympanometry test, which measures the movement of the eardrum in response to pressure changes. This can help determine if there is any fluid or obstruction in the middle ear.\n3.

However, it is important to note that antibiotics are not always necessary for every case of Eustachian tube dysfunction.\n\nIn the meantime, the patient can try the following self-care measures:\n\n- Gently blow your nose to help clear any excess mucus from the sinuses.\n- Use a humidifier to mo",

Thank you.\n\n### Response:Based on the information provided, it is important to understand that HIV testing is a complex topic and there are various factors to consider. Here are some clarifications:\n\n1. The \"window period\" refers to the time after exposure to HIV when someone may not yet have developed antibodies against the virus. During this period, HIV tests can still detect the presence of the virus even though it may not yet show up as positive on standard tests. The duration of the window period can vary from person to person and is typically around 3-12 weeks.\n\n2. It is true that some individuals may not develop detectable levels of HIV antibodies until several months after exposure. However, it is generally accepted that most people will develop detectable levels within 3-12 weeks.\n\n3. The six-month rule you mentioned is based on the fact that most laboratory tests for HIV become conclusive at six months after exposure. This means that if a person remains negative throughout this period, the test results are considered highly reliable and conclusive.\n\n4. However, it is important to note that no test is 100% reliable, and false negatives can occur. False negatives may happen due to various factors such as sample collection errors, laboratory mistakes, or the presence of certain substances in the blood that can interfere with testing.\n\n5. In",

We checked home pregnancy kit and it was negative. What could be the reason for delayed menses?\n\n### Response:Based on the information provided, there are a few possible reasons for the delayed menstrual period:\n\n1. I-pill effect: The I-pill is a type of emergency contraception that can delay or inhibit ovulation. If your wife took I-pills within 24 hours of unprotected sex on both occasions, it is possible that this could have caused a delay in her menstrual cycle.\n\n2. Hormonal imbalance: It is also possible that there may be a hormonal imbalance or disruption in her body, which can affect the regularity of her menstrual cycle. This could be due to various factors such as stress, changes in weight, thyroid disorders, or certain medications.\n\n3.

Adenoidectomy is the surgical procedure to remove the adenoids, which are located in the back of the throat, above the tongue.\n\nThe success rate of this surgery in improving voice quality and speech difficulties due to enlarged adenoids is generally high. However, it is important to note that there can be variables that affect the outcome, such as individual anatomy, severity of enlargement, and other underlying conditions.\n\nIn most cases, patients experience significant improvement in their voice after adenoidectomy. However, there is a small percentage of individuals who may not achieve optimal voice improvement or may experience temporary worsening of their voice after the surgery. This can be due to various factors such as incomplete removal of the adenoids, recurrence of enlargement, or underlying conditions affecting voice production.\n\nIt is essential to discuss your specific concerns and expectations with your surgeon before the procedure.

Yesterday, I noticed what appeared to be a bald spot in my pubic hair above the penis. When I trimmed the hair back, it revealed a quarter sized bald spot and a smaller dime sized spot. I am not sure how long they may have been there as they were somewhat masked by a longer pubic hair. So, now I have what I believe to be three spots, two below abdomen and one on beard. My concern is more of them spreading than the current spots.I am now thinking back about the annual checkup that I had with my GP six months back.

It is possible that these factors could contribute to a decrease in testosterone levels, which can affect sexual function and lead to decreased semen production.\n\nLow WBC count, or leukocytosis, can indicate an infection or inflammation in the body. In some cases, it can be a sign of a primary immunodeficiency disorder or an underlying infection.\n\nAlopecia areata, which causes small triangular bald spots, can occur due to an autoimmune response where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks its own hair follicles. This condition can affect hair on the scalp, eyebrows, eyelashes, or other parts of the body.\n\nFolliculitis, on the other hand, refers to inflammation of the hair follicles.

This is known as meconium-stained stool and can be a sign of meconium aspiration syndrome.\n\nMeconium aspiration syndrome occurs when the baby inhales or swallows meconium (the baby's first stool) during vaginal delivery or cesarean section. The meconium can then get into the amniotic fluid and cause respiratory problems for the baby.\n\nIt is important to seek medical attention promptly if you notice this change in your stool. Your healthcare provider will need to assess the situation and determine the best course of action. They may recommend further tests such as amniocentesis or ultrasound to evaluate the baby's well-being and provide appropriate interventions if necessary.\n\nPlease contact your healthcare provider immediately to discuss your concerns and schedule an appointment for further evaluation.",

This situation has taken place twice. I do not have soft drinks, coffee, and chocolates. I am very upset about this situation. Please help.\n\n### Response:Based on the patient's description, it seems that they are experiencing recurrent dental deposits that develop after scaling and then reappear after a period of time. This can be indicative of a dental condition called dental erosion.\n\nDental erosion occurs when the tooth enamel is worn away by acids present in certain foods and beverages. Common causes of dental erosion include excessive consumption of sugary drinks, such as soda and fruit juices, as well as consuming acidic foods like citrus fruits and tomatoes.\n\nTo help prevent dental erosion, it is important for the patient to minimize or avoid consuming these acidic foods and beverages. Additionally, it may be beneficial for the patient to rinse their mouth with water after consuming acidic foods or drinks to help neutralize the acid.\n\nIf the patient continues to experience recurrent dental deposits despite making these lifestyle changes, it would be advisable for them to consult with a dentist for further evaluation and treatment options. The dentist may recommend dental procedures such as dental sealants, fluoride treatments, or in severe cases, dental restorations to address the erosion.\n\nPlease note that this response is based solely on the information provided by the patient and does not",

I did go to the hospital to get it treated. The doctor cut off half of my nail, cleaned and dressed it, and kept re-visiting to get the dressing changed. The doctor said that I could stop re-visiting. And then she told me that the nail would have to be removed again after it grows back fully. But, I am hesitant and kind of rejecting to do so.After a month, the nail is not loose anymore, but the nail seems to be growing outwards, and between the nail and the nail bed, there is a gap (kind of like a hollow gap inside). Should I just wait until the nail fully grows back? Should I cut it? What should I do? I am really worried that it will not grow and it will completely fall off once I start wearing shoes.

This can occur after trauma or as a result of certain medical conditions.\n\nIn your case, the nail is growing outwards and there is a gap between the nail and the nail bed. It is important to note that onychomadesis is not a serious condition and typically resolves on its own without any intervention.\n\nI would recommend waiting until the nail fully grows back before making any decisions about removing it again. During this time, you can keep the area clean and dry to prevent infection.\n\nIf you are concerned about protecting your toe while participating in horse riding and hiking, you can consider wearing appropriate footwear that provides support and protection for your toe. Additionally, you can apply a clear nail polish over the affected area to protect it from injury.\n\nIt is important to consult with a healthcare professional, such as a podiatrist, if you have any concerns or if your symptoms worsen.

Abnormal t-wave: The t-wave is responsible for representing ventricular repolarization. An abnormal t-wave can be indicative of various cardiac conditions, including myocardial ischemia (lack of blood flow to the heart muscle).\n\n2. High QRS voltage: A high QRS voltage suggests an abnormal electrical conduction pathway in the heart. It can be seen in conditions such as ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation.\n\n3. Abnormal Qtc: Qtc stands for the duration of the QRS complex on the ECG tracing. An abnormal Qtc can indicate underlying heart disease or arrhythmias.\n\n4. Pulse 60: A resting heart rate of 60 beats per minute is considered bradycardia, which may be due to various causes including autonomic nervous system dysfunction, medication side effects, or cardiac pathology.\n\n5. Marfan syndrome present: Marfan syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the connective tissues in the body, including the heart valves and aorta.

By waiting until your placebo week (which starts on a weekday) and taking only the placebos until the weekend, you can avoid withdrawal bleeding without losing the contraceptive coverage. Then, you can start a new pack on the following weekday and continue taking the active pills as usual.",

I would like to know whether my eye power is too weak. Is there any other way available to correct cylindrical power?\n\n### Response:Based on your eye test results, it appears that you have a cylindrical correction in addition to a spherical correction. The cylindrical power is measured in units called \"degress\" (DC). The values you provided are:\n\n-6/18 with a cylinder power of -1.25 DC\n-6/6 with a cylinder power of -0.25 DC\n-6/9 with a cylinder power of -0.75 DC\n\nThese values indicate that you have astigmatism, which means that your eye is shaped more like a football rather than a round ball.\n\nThe standard method for correcting cylindrical power is through the use of cylindrical lenses in glasses or contact lenses. These lenses have a specific curvature that compensates for the astigmatism.\n\nIn your case, since your spherical correction is still within the normal range (20/20), it is unlikely that your eye power is too weak. However, it is important to consult with an optician or an ophthalmologist who can provide a comprehensive evaluation and recommend the best options for correcting your cylindrical power. They will be able to guide you on the type and strength of lenses needed to address your specific visual requirements.",

Marijuana contains THC, which can affect the healing of the tooth and the surrounding tissues. Here are a few potential effects:\n\n1. Delayed healing: Marijuana use can slow down the healing process by affecting blood flow to the area. This can lead to delayed healing and increased risk of infection.\n\n2. Increased pain: Some individuals may experience increased pain after using marijuana, especially if they have a history of sensitivity to pain.\n\n3. Impaired judgment: Marijuana can affect cognitive function and impair judgment, which may increase the risk of accidents or injuries related to oral health.\n\n4. Dry socket: Marijuana use has been associated with an increased risk of developing a condition called dry socket, which is characterized by severe pain and inflammation in the jaw.\n\nIt is important to consult with your dentist or endodontist regarding any concerns or questions you may have about post-operative care following a root canal treatment.

        "input": "Hi doctor,I am a 23 year old male, a third-year medical student. For the past seven days, I have had an increased urgency and frequency to urinate. I can go even more than 30 times a day - majority of these times, I feel an increased urgency. However, when I go, only a small amount or drops come out. For the past two to three days, the urgency kind of feels to be getting worse, I feel as if I will not be able to hold it. However, I am still able to as there is no leaking. There is no burning or irritation or any discharge. No recent sexual encounters and no other associated symptoms. I take Coveram 10/10 for essential hypertension and Valdoxan 25 because I also do suffer from anxiety. I have been under stress lately as I was doing my exams this past week and finished today. I have done a few tests at my family doctor: Last week I did a dipstick which was normal apart from +1 protein. Voiding bladder US was normal (450 mL pre voiding, 45 mL post voiding). An initial urine culture was normal according to my doctor. Yesterday, I performed another dipstick and urine culture. The dipstick was normal, and early urine microscopy showed 10 to 100 white cell count. We are waiting for the cultures to return. Due to the result of the white cell count, my doctor said it would be worth a try to undergo a 5-day course of antibiotics (Keflex).Today is my third day of antibiotic treatment, symptoms are largely the same. Today, I attempted to hold my bladder. It felt fine in the morning but as the day went on, my symptoms returned and I am finding it harder to hold my bladder. Also, for the first time, I tried going for a run. The entire time I felt a heaviness in my bladder and felt a strong urge to urinate, even though I went before my run began. What do you think could be going on? My doctor believes that it is either a UTI, or most likely, a hypersensitive bladder due to exam stress. However, there have been days where I have not felt stress at all yet symptoms have continued. I am really worried as I want to go back to work in five days and I do not think I will be able to manage the way things are at the moment. My family doctor does think this will settle down now that I have finished exams. Do you think there is a chance it could? I have mentioned this query to another doctor online, and he believed it may be due to an overactive bladder. However, since I am relatively young to receive this diagnosis, I wanted a second opinion, if that is alright. Do you think this could be OAB? I am worried that it could be something serious, like multiple sclerosis. One and a half years ago, I had an episode of sudden onset numbness in one arm and fearing the same thing, I ended up having an MRI of my brain and lumbar spine which both came back negative. Do you think this could be MS?",

Do you think this could be MS?\n\n### Response:Based on the information provided, it is possible that you are experiencing symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI) or a hypersensitive bladder due to exam stress. However, it is important to consider other possibilities as well.\n\nThe presence of a small amount of urine or drops when urinating could be indicative of a UTI. UTIs often present with increased urgency and frequency of urination, along with a sensation of needing to urinate immediately. The fact that your symptoms have been worsening over time suggests a possible progression of the infection.\n\nOn the other hand, an overactive bladder (OAB) can also cause similar symptoms. OAB occurs when the muscles that control the bladder spasm too frequently, leading to a sudden and strong need to urinate. This can result in small amounts of urine being expelled.\n\nGiven your age and the absence of other symptoms, it is less likely that you have multiple sclerosis (MS). MS typically presents with a variety of neurological symptoms, including sensory disturbances, muscle weakness, and coordination problems. The fact that you had a negative MRI of your brain and lumbar spine suggests that MS is less likely.\n\nTo determine the exact cause of your symptoms, further evaluation is necessary. I",

The symptoms of pinworms include itching around the anus, especially at night, and a sensation of something moving in the anal area. The vibrating sensation described by the patient could be attributed to the movement of the worms.\n\nRegarding the treatment, taking Reese's Pinworm medicine for four days is sufficient to eliminate the infection. It is important to follow the recommended dosage and duration of treatment.\n\nIn terms of preventing reinfection, it is advisable to practice good hygiene, such as thoroughly washing hands after using the bathroom and before preparing food, and keeping the anal area clean and dry. It is also recommended to avoid sharing personal items, such as towels or clothing, with others.\n\nAs for the home remedies mentioned, apple cider vinegar may help to create an uninviting environment for the worms, but it is not known to cause them to come out alive or dead.

Let me address your questions:\n\n1. Can our marriage create a reduced genetic pool?\nMarrying a close relative, such as your maternal uncle's daughter, can potentially reduce the genetic diversity in your offspring. This is because both you and your partner share a common ancestor, which means that you have a higher chance of inheriting similar versions of certain genes from each other. However, it is important to note that not all genetic disorders are caused by reduced genetic diversity.\n\n2. Can I marry the girl?\nIn India, marriages between close relatives (consanguineous relationships) are regulated by laws and customs. The specific rules may vary depending on your location and religious beliefs. It is advisable to consult with a legal expert or a genetic counselor who can provide you with accurate guidance based on your specific circumstances.\n\n3. Will I have kids if I marry her?\nAs long as both you and your partner are physically capable of having children, there is a chance of having children even if you are closely related. However, the risk of having genetic disorders or birth defects may be slightly higher compared to individuals who are not closely related.\n\n4. Will I have future",

However, it is important to note that not all genetic disorders are caused by reduced genetic diversity.\n\n2. Can I marry the girl?\nIn India, marriages between close relatives (consanguineous relationships) are regulated by laws and customs. The specific rules may vary depending on your location and religious beliefs. It is advisable to consult with a legal expert or a genetic counselor who can provide you with accurate guidance based on your specific circumstances.\n\n3. Will I have kids if I marry her?\nAs long as both you and your partner are physically capable of having children, there is a chance of having children even if you are closely related. However, the risk of having genetic disorders or birth defects may be slightly higher compared to individuals who are not closely related.\n\n4. Will I have future"

        "input": "Hi doctor,I have been taking 4 mg of Xanax a day to treat severe panic attack syndrome and associated high levels of general anxiety for 15 years. My doctor arrived at the 4 mg per day amount gradually and it works very well along with CBT from a therapist. Before two months, when I received the medication from the pharmacy it was for 3 mg /day. I asked them to double check and that was the quantity that my doctor had written. I call his office and the office manager said that she would ask him about it. When I called the next day she said that he did not make a mistake and I asked for an explanation and was told that he did not give one.I started to feel sick a few days later and panic attacks actually started to increase the day that I talk to his office manager. I suffered minor but disruptive withdrawal symptoms physically and mentally for about two weeks and then they subsided but panic attacks continued to occur at random every day and my GAD symptoms increased to the point where CBT methods were not working.Then last month, the script was back to 4 mg per day normal dosage. I thought yes, back to normal. But again this month the script was back down to 3 mg per day which means I am going to experience a minor hell again.I am a defense and aerospace engineer who works on a contract basis through an agency and the client had noticed a drop in my performance before month but back to normal last month, now they are going to see it again and I will probably lose the contract job. I also started online system engineer classes and I am freaking out over being able to handle the exams and homework as I typically work on the class at night and am now without my evening dose. I again asked for an explanation and was not given any.My question is a 25% cut in dosage physically dangerous and I am well aware of the strong psychological addition issues, so will this settle down before my career and social life and general well being take a hit and I revert to hiding in my apartment with my dog and my employer and friends will give up on me.",

It is important to consider all the available options before making a decision.\n\n1. Ahmed Valve Implant: The Ahmed valve implant is a traditional surgical option for treating glaucoma. It involves placing a small, silicone-based valve within the eye to help regulate intraocular pressure. While it has been used for many years, it does have potential risks, including infection, bleeding, and adverse effects on vision.\n\n2. MIGS (Minimally Invasive Glaucoma Surgery): MIGS procedures, such as Xen Gel Stent and InnFocus Microshunt, are newer minimally invasive options for treating glaucoma. These procedures aim to reduce intraocular pressure by improving the drainage of aqueous humor from the eye. They are less invasive than traditional surgeries and have a lower risk of complications. However, they may not be suitable for all patients, and the effectiveness can vary depending on the severity of the glaucoma.\n\nConsidering the options, it would be best to consult with a glaucoma specialist who can evaluate your mother's specific case and recommend the most appropriate treatment plan.

As a doctor, I can provide some guidance on managing your weight and body composition as a type 1 diabetic.\n\nFirstly, it's important to note that weight gain can be a common issue for individuals with diabetes, especially if blood sugar levels are not well controlled. This can lead to insulin resistance and increased abdominal fat deposition.\n\nTo address your specific concerns, I would recommend the following:\n\n1. Continue with your current resistance training routine: Resistance training, such as weightlifting, can help build muscle mass and increase metabolism. This can be beneficial for overall body composition.\n\n2. Evaluate your diet: Ensure that your caloric intake is balanced and meets your energy needs. Consider working with a registered dietitian who specializes in diabetes management to create a personalized meal plan that takes into account your specific nutritional requirements and preferences.\n\n3. Monitor your blood sugar levels: Regular monitoring of blood glucose levels will help you assess the impact of your insulin dosage and dietary choices on your blood sugar control. Adjustments may need to be made to optimize your insulin regimen based on these results.\n\n4. Consult with a healthcare professional: Consider scheduling",

Twice I was bleeding along with the stroke. One type of bleeding was chronic and the other one was acute. I would like to know which type of bleeding is dangerous? And also explain the reason for the same.\n\n### Response:Based on the description you provided, it seems like you are experiencing a hemorrhagic stroke. Hemorrhagic strokes occur when there is bleeding into the brain due to the rupture of blood vessels.\n\nChronic bleeding refers to the slow and gradual accumulation of blood within the brain over a period of time. This type of bleeding is often associated with conditions such as arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) or weakened blood vessel walls. Chronic bleeding can lead to the accumulation of fluid and blood products in the brain, causing increased pressure and damage to brain tissue.\n\nAcute bleeding, on the other hand, refers to the sudden and rapid accumulation of blood within the brain. Acute bleeding can occur due to various reasons, such as the rupture of a blood vessel or the formation of a hematoma (a collection of blood outside the blood vessels). Acute bleeding can be life-threatening as it leads to a sudden decrease in blood supply to the brain, resulting in cell death and potential organ damage.\n\nIn terms of danger, both types of bleeding can be dangerous and require immediate medical attention. However, acute bleeding is generally considered more dangerous as it can quickly lead to significant brain damage or even be life-threatening. Therefore, it is important to seek immediate medical care if you are",

What I want to ask is, if there are any other tests that could detect why this is happening and how this could be treated?\n\n### Response:Based on the patient's description, it seems that they are experiencing tinnitus, which is the perception of sound in the ears that does not originate from the external environment. Tinnitus can have various causes, including exposure to loud noise, ear infections, and certain underlying medical conditions.\n\nThe fact that the patient's tinnitus is not constant but rather changes in intensity suggests that it may be related to the functioning of the auditory system rather than being solely caused by a cold or infection.\n\nTo further evaluate the cause of the tinnitus and explore potential treatment options, I would recommend the following steps:\n\n1.

In this case, since the husband has a low sperm count and motility, IVF with ICSI may be recommended to increase the chances of successful fertilization.\n\nRegarding the patient's concerns about OHSS (Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome) during IVF, it is possible for patients with PCOS to develop OHSS due to the excessive stimulation of the ovaries during ovarian drilling or controlled ovarian stimulation.

The patient's husband is experiencing erectile dysfunction and has been prescribed Edon and Maxoza for the past three months. They underwent IUI last month, but the fertility specialist advised IVF with ICSI since the husband's sperm count was low.\n\nIn terms of the patient's question about whether it is necessary to do IVF with ICSI in their case, it depends on various factors such as the severity of the male factor infertility, the patient's age, and the overall fertility potential. In this case, since the husband has a low sperm count and motility, IVF with ICSI may be recommended to increase the chances of successful fertilization.\n\nRegarding the patient's concerns about OHSS (Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome) during IVF, it is possible for patients with PCOS to develop OHSS due to the excessive stimulation of the ovaries during ovarian drilling or controlled ovarian stimulation. However, the risk of OHSS can be minim"

The decision to place spikes is made by your orthodontist based on your individual treatment plan. Typically, spikes are not placed during the initial visit but may be added during subsequent visits as needed.\n\n2. Rubber bands and power chain: These are two different types of elastic bands used in orthodontic treatment. Rubber bands are usually applied by the patient themselves and help in moving teeth by applying gentle pressure. Power chains, on the other hand, are attached to your brackets and move the teeth by pulling on a chain attached to them. Both rubber bands and power chains are usually provided by your orthodontist during routine visits.\n\nIt is important to consult with your orthodontist for specific information regarding your treatment plan and when you can expect to receive spikes, rubber bands, and power chains.

How to find whether the seizure is caused by the tumor or by the trauma or both?\n\n### Response:Based on the information provided, it is possible that the seizure could be caused by either the tumor or the trauma, or both. To determine the exact cause of the seizure, further evaluation is needed.\n\nI would recommend scheduling an appointment with a neurologist who specializes in epilepsy. They will be able to conduct a thorough examination, review your medical history, and order additional tests if necessary. These tests may include an EEG (electroencephalogram) with video telemetry, which can record the electrical activity of your brain during a seizure, as well as other imaging studies such as an MRI or PET scan.\n\nThe neurologist will analyze the results of these tests, along with your clinical presentation, to make a definitive diagnosis and determine the underlying cause of your seizures. It is important to consult with a medical professional who can provide a comprehensive evaluation and guide you towards appropriate treatment options.",

The dentist may need to re-evaluate the fit of the crown or perform a root canal retreatment if necessary. Additionally, it is important to rule out any allergies that could be causing the symptoms. The dentist may consider prescribing antibiotics if there is evidence of infection or inflammation around the affected tooth.",

It involves reshaping the bones and cartilage of the nose to achieve a more aesthetically pleasing or functional nose.\n\nIn your case, if your nose is growing towards the left side, it may be due to a condition called deviated septum.

This can cause one side of the nose to grow larger than the other.\n\nRhinoplasty can help correct this by reshaping the nasal septum and other structures to improve the symmetry of your nose. However, it is important to consult with a plastic surgeon or an otolaryngologist (ear, nose, and throat specialist) who can evaluate your specific condition and recommend the most appropriate treatment plan for you.

It involves reshaping the bones and cartilage of the nose to achieve a more aesthetically pleasing or functional nose.\n\nIn your case, if your nose is growing towards the left side, it may be due to a condition called deviated septum. The deviated septum occurs when the nasal septum (the wall that divides the nasal passages) is displaced to one side. This can cause one side of the nose to grow larger than the other.\n\nRhinoplasty can help correct this by reshaping the nasal septum and other structures to improve the symmetry of your nose. However, it is important to consult with a plastic surgeon or an otolaryngologist (ear, nose, and throat specialist) who can evaluate your specific condition and recommend the most appropriate treatment plan for you. They will consider factors such as the severity of the deviation, your overall facial structure, and your goals for the surgery.\n\nPlease note that I am an AI language model and cannot provide personalized medical advice.

I mean what should be our first step? Even if I pull out, is there any chances that she will get pregnant? Which condom is a perfect fit for starters like us? Is there any natural ways too to make sure no sperm left inside?\n\n### Response:As a doctor, I understand your concerns about condom size and the risk of pregnancy. Let me provide you with some information to help you make informed decisions.\n\n1. Pregnancy risk: Even if you pull out before ejaculation, there is still a small chance of pregnancy. The likelihood of pregnancy depends on various factors such as the timing of intercourse, the woman's fertile days, and the sperm's ability to swim through the cervical mucus. It is always recommended to use additional methods of contraception, such as condoms or another form of barrier method, to further reduce the risk of pregnancy.\n\n2. Condom fit: It is important to use condoms that fit properly. A condom that is too loose can allow semen to spill out, increasing the risk of pregnancy. On the other hand, a condom that is too tight can cause discomfort and reduce sensation for both partners. I recommend using condoms that are labeled as \"fitness\" or \"magic size\" condoms. These condoms are designed to be a standard size and provide a comfortable fit for most individuals.\n\n3. Natural methods: There are several natural methods that can help prevent pregnancy. One option is to abstain from intercourse during the woman's fertile days (usually around the time",

The initial injury, where the ball hit the outside of your foot causing your ankle to turn inward and pop a few times, suggests a high-energy impact.

In some cases, a misaligned or unstable joint can cause referred pain or sensations in other areas.\n\nConsidering the ongoing pain, swelling, and dislocated feeling, it is advisable to seek further medical evaluation by an orthopedic specialist or sports medicine physician.

While it is possible that the dog may have licked your toddler's hand without causing any harm, it is still advisable to take precautionary measures.\n\nFirstly, it is crucial to monitor your child closely for any signs of infection or illness, such as fever, rash, or difficulty breathing. If you notice any concerning symptoms, it is recommended to seek medical attention immediately.\n\nSecondly, if your child develops any symptoms within the next few days, it is important to contact your healthcare provider for further evaluation. They may recommend a tetanus booster shot or other appropriate medical interventions based on the specific situation.\n\nIn the meantime, it would be prudent to keep a close eye on your child's immunization status. Ensure that he has received all necessary vaccinations, including the tetanus shot, to protect against potential infections.\n\nLastly, educate your child about the importance of staying away from stray animals and not touching them without permission.

Please tell me I really want to know.\n\n### Response:Hello,\n\nAs a doctor, I can provide you with some information regarding your question. Sinusitis is an inflammation of the sinuses, which are air-filled cavities located within the skull bones surrounding the nose and eyes. Sinusitis can be caused by various factors, including viral or bacterial infections, allergies, or structural abnormalities.\n\nIn terms of Coronavirus (COVID-19), it primarily affects the respiratory system, specifically the lungs and airways. However, it is important to note that COVID-19 can also affect other parts of the body, including the sinuses. While COVID-19 can cause respiratory symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath, and fever, it may not necessarily present with all these symptoms in every individual.\n\nGiven that you do not face any breathing problems, it is less likely for COVID-19 to directly affect your sinuses. However, it is still possible for the virus to enter your body through other routes, such as the eyes, nose, or mouth, and potentially cause sinus inflammation or irritation.\n\nIt is crucial to follow the guidelines provided by healthcare authorities and take necessary precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

The pain has improved since yesterday.\n\nThe new chiropractor thinks that the patient's right hip was tilted forward, causing the muscles on the left to get spasm and be in pain.\n\nBased on this information, it is possible that the chiropractic adjustments during the first visit may have caused an exacerbation of the patient's condition. It is important to consider the possibility of a post-chiropractic adjustment syndrome (PCAS) or \"poorly tolerated manipulation\" reaction.\n\nIn such cases, it is recommended to take the following steps:\n\n1. Rest and avoid activities that worsen the pain: The patient should avoid any activities that aggravate the pain and rest as much as possible.\n\n2. Apply ice or cold therapy: Applying ice or cold therapy to the affected area can"

The uterine tubes are patent bilaterally. There is bilateral spontaneous contrast m\\xc3\\xa9dium spillage into the peritoneal cavity. The contrast filled uterine cavity demonstrates normal morphology with a central immobile smooth spherical filling defect.\n\n### Response:The HSG test, also known as a hysterosalpingogram, is a diagnostic procedure used to evaluate the uterus and fallopian tubes. It involves injecting a contrast dye into the uterus through the cervix and taking X-ray images to assess the structure and function of these reproductive organs.\n\nBased on the description provided, it appears that the HSG test was performed and the results are as follows:\n\n1. The uterine tubes are patent bilaterally: This means that the fallopian tubes are open and not blocked.\n\n2. Bilateral spontaneous contrast medium spillage into the peritoneal cavity: This indicates that the contrast dye spontaneously leaked into the space surrounding the uterus and ovaries, known as the peritoneal cavity.\n\n3. The contrast filled uterine cavity demonstrates normal morphology with a central immobile smooth spherical filling defect: The uterus appears normal in shape and size, and there is a small area of the uterine lining that did not absorb the contrast dye, resulting in a visible defect.\n\nBased on these findings, it suggests that there may be a problem with the uterine lining, such as a uterine septum or a condition called Asherman's synd",

It is typically caused by bacteria that become trapped between the tooth and the gum. The symptoms you are experiencing, including swelling and pain behind the wisdom tooth, are consistent with pericoronitis.\n\nGiven that you have been taking antibiotics for two days and not experiencing improvement, it is possible that the infection may not be completely resolved with this initial course of treatment. In such cases, it is common for a second round of antibiotics to be prescribed.\n\nHowever, before considering additional antibiotics, it would be advisable to wait for a few more days to see if there is any improvement. If you do not notice any improvement by the end of this week, I would recommend scheduling an appointment with your dentist to reassess the situation.\n\nIn the meantime, continuing with the prescribed Ibuprofen can help alleviate pain and reduce inflammation.

Even if you did not ejaculate directly into her vagina, the sperm that was on your penis could have entered her vagina during foreplay or fingering. Additionally, if some drops of semen had fallen by chance on her outer vagina, it could also increase the chances of pregnancy.\n\nTo reduce the risk of pregnancy, it is recommended to use a barrier method such as a condom during sexual activity.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.\n\n### Input:\nHello doctor, I am currently taking a low dose of combined birth control medication (Femme 20/100) containing 21 hormone tablets and 7 placebo tablets. I was on a higher dose of contraceptive medication (Microgynon 30). Microgynon 30 was switched to lower dose pill because of severe PMS type symptoms. Currently, I am taking Ritalin 60 mg per day in 3 x 20 mg intervals, Abilify 300 mg depot injection monthly, Femme 20/100 contraceptive pill and Clonazepam 2 mg twice a day as needed. I had unprotected sex on day 6 of inactive pill. I forgot to take active pills on day 1, 3 and 4. But, I had 2 pills on day 2 and had unprotected intercourse. I am concerned about the possibility of pregnancy. It is now day 5 and I am regular on my pill. Am I at risk for a possible pregnancy due to missing so many hormonal pills? Also, what should I do from this point onwards? Should I continue as normal or begin a new packet entirely?\n\n### Response:Based on the information provided, it is possible that you may be at risk for a pregnancy due to missed hormonal pills. The ideal way to prevent pregnancy when you miss pills is to take emergency contraception as soon as possible after missing the pills.\n\nEmergency contraception can be taken up to 5 days after unprotected intercourse. It is important to note that emergency contraception may not be as effective if you delay in taking it.\n\nIn this case, since you had unprotected intercourse on day 6 of inactive pills and missed pills on days 1, 3, and 4, it would be advisable to take emergency contraception as soon as possible.\n\nI recommend consulting with a healthcare professional or visiting a pharmacy to obtain emergency contraception. They will be able to provide you with appropriate guidance and assist you in taking the necessary steps to prevent a potential pregnancy.\n\nFrom this point onwards, it is best to continue taking your regular pill pack without skipping any doses. If you experience any concerns or side effects, it is always advisable to consult with your healthcare provider.",

I do a lot of kicking, and I do not want to injure myself.\n\n### Response:Based on the description you provided, it seems like you are experiencing a condition called \"hip impingement\" or \"snapping hip syndrome.\" This occurs when the hip joint is compressed as it moves through its range of motion, resulting in a clicking or snapping sensation.\n\nThe pain you feel during a center split is likely due to the increased stress on the hip joint during this movement. The stopping pain in your outer hip with no stretch in your inner thigh suggests that the pain is coming from the iliotibial (IT) band, which is a thick band of tissue that runs from the hip to the shinbone.\n\nTo address this issue, I would recommend the following:\n\n1. Stretching: Performing specific stretches for the IT band can help improve flexibility and relieve pain. Some effective stretches include the \"butterfly stretch,\" \"standing hip flexor stretch,\" and \"side-lying hip flexor stretch.\"\n\n2. Strengthening exercises: Incorporating exercises that strengthen the muscles surrounding the hip joint, such as the glutes and core muscles, can help stabilize the hip and reduce the risk of impingement. Examples of these exercises include bridging, clamshells, and planks.\n\n3. Modify activities: If certain movements or activities exacerbate your sympt",

The first trimester NT (nuchal translucency) test and double marker test indicated a low risk of 1:3690 for DS and 1:100000 for two other abnormalities.\n\nDuring the second-trimester anomaly scan, two markers were identified - CP cyst and mild RPD (resorption plate degeneration) measurements of 4 mm and 4.5 mm. While these findings may indicate a slightly increased risk, it is important to note that they are still within the range considered normal.\n\nConsidering the low risk indicated by the initial screening tests and the fact that the second-trimester markers are within normal limits, it is unlikely that there is a need to worry. However, it is always recommended to follow up with your healthcare provider for further evaluation and discussion.\n\nIn the absence of any results from the NIPT (non-invasive prenatal testing) blood test, it is possible that there may be a delay in receiving the results. NIPT is a screening test that can provide additional information about the risk of certain chromosomal abnormalities, including DS.\n\nIt is important to remember that",

It is important to note that TN is a separate condition from migraines or simple partial seizures.\n\nIn terms of managing TN, there are several medications that can be used.

This is why it is important to monitor Lamictal levels before starting Carbamazepine and adjust the Lamictal dosage if necessary.\n\nOxcarbazepine is another anticonvulsant medication that can be used as an alternative to Carbamazepine. It has a similar effectiveness in reducing TN pain but may not have the same impact on Lamictal levels.\n\nIn terms of adjusting Lamictal dosage while adding Carbamazepine or Oxcarbazepine, it is generally recommended",

Is this hike in the value of Rubella IgG and CMV IgG the cause of miscarriage? Please guide us.\n\n### Response:Based on the information provided, the TORCH test results for your wife indicate the presence of specific antibodies that can be associated with certain infections during pregnancy.\n\nThe rubella IgG level of 270.30 is higher than the normal range, which suggests a recent or past infection with the rubella virus. The rubella virus can cause severe birth defects if a pregnant woman becomes infected.\n\nSimilarly, the CMV (cytomegalovirus) IgG level of 118.60 is also higher than the normal range. CMV infection during pregnancy can also lead to complications, including miscarriage or birth defects.\n\nIt is important to note that while elevated levels of these antibodies can be associated with adverse outcomes such as miscarriage, they do not necessarily indicate the cause of the miscarriage. Other factors, such as genetic abnormalities or other infections, could also contribute to the miscarriage.\n\nTo determine the exact cause of the miscarriage, further investigations may be necessary, such as genetic testing or additional blood tests. It would be best to consult with your gynecologist who can provide a more comprehensive evaluation based on your specific situation.",

However, I can provide some general information that may help in understanding the possible conditions.\n\n1. Tinea versicolor: This is a common fungal infection of the skin that causes patches of discolored skin. It typically affects areas with excessive sweating and tends to come and go.\n\n2. Hypopigmentation: This refers to areas of decreased pigmentation in the skin, resulting in lighter or white patches. It can occur due to various reasons, including inflammation or injury to the skin.\n\n3. Vitiligo: Vitiligo is a chronic autoimmune condition that leads to loss of pigment in certain areas of the skin. It typically presents as white or depigmented patches.\n\n4. Postinflammatory hypopigmentation: This refers to a condition where there is temporary loss of pigmentation following an inflammatory event, such as a skin infection or inflammation.\n\nIt is important to note that these are just possible explanations based on the given information. A thorough evaluation by a dermatologist or a skin specialist would be necessary to make an accurate diagnosis and determine the appropriate treatment plan.\n\nI recommend consulting with a der",

While it is concerning that your hCG levels have not doubled properly, it does not necessarily mean that you will miscarry.\n\nHCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) is a hormone produced by the developing placenta. Its levels typically double every 48-72 hours during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, there can be natural variations in hCG levels, and not all pregnancies follow a perfectly linear increase.\n\nTo assess the health of your pregnancy, it is important to consider other factors such as the gestational age of the fetus, ultrasound findings, and any symptoms you may be experiencing. A follow-up ultrasound can provide more information about the growth and well-being of your fetus.\n\nI would recommend scheduling an appointment with your healthcare provider to discuss these results and any concerns you may have.

A contusion occurs when there is a direct impact to the forearm, causing damage to the tissues and resulting in a localized swelling and lump.\n\nSince the lump does not cause pain when moving your arm or picking things up, and there is no mention of any deformity or inability to use your arm, it is unlikely that you have a fracture. However, I cannot provide a definitive diagnosis without examining the area.\n\nIn your case, it may be best to monitor the lump for any changes in size, shape, or symptoms over the next few days. If the pain worsens or if you notice any signs of infection such as redness, warmth, or pus, it would be advisable to seek medical attention.\n\nWithout further information or a physical examination, I cannot rule out the possibility of a fracture.

I have a family and a child. Can I have sex with my wife without protection? Next test needed or not?\n\n### Response:Based on the information provided, it seems like you have been exposed to HIV and are concerned about your status. I will provide you with some information regarding HIV testing and the window period.\n\n1. HIV DNA PCR test at 66 days: The HIV DNA PCR test is a highly sensitive test that can detect HIV even during the early stages of infection. It is recommended to be conducted within 28 days after exposure. Since your last exposure was protected but you are not sure about the vaginal fluid contact, it is possible that the HIV DNA PCR test at 66 days might not have detected HIV due to the early stage of infection.\n\n2. Tridot rapid test: The tridot rapid test is a rapid antibody test that detects HIV antibodies in the blood. It is recommended to be conducted after the HIV DNA PCR test at 66 days if the previous test was negative. The negative results of the tridot rapid test at 83, 88, 93, and 99 days indicate that you are likely HIV negative.\n\n3. Tridot non-reactive: The tridot non-reactive result means that no HIV antibodies were detected in the blood. This further supports the negative result of the previous tests.\n\n4. Hbs",

Would oral or genital herpes look like this in the mouth? Could it be mouth cancer?\n\n### Response:Based on the description you provided, it is possible that the sores and blood blisters in your mouth could be caused by oral herpes (herpes simplex virus 1 - HSV-1). HSV-1 is commonly associated with cold sores and can also cause mouth ulcers.\n\nThe fact that you had a negative result for HSV-1 on the swab test does not rule out the possibility of infection, as it can take several weeks for the virus to be detected in the blood. It is also important to note that HSV-1 can be transmitted through close contact with an infected person, even if they do not have visible sores.\n\nWhile oral herpes typically presents with painful sores in the mouth, it is less common for it to cause blood blisters. However, other conditions such as mouth cancer can also present with similar symptoms.\n\nTo further evaluate your condition, I would recommend scheduling an appointment with a healthcare professional who can conduct a thorough examination of your mouth and consider other potential causes of your symptoms, such as oral cancer. They may also request additional tests or refer you to a specialist if necessary.\n\nPlease consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate management of your symptoms.",

All I have is just some premature ventricular contractions.\n\n### Response:Hello,\n\nAn echocardiogram and ECG can help diagnose restrictive cardiomyopathy, but they are not definitive tests for this condition. Restrictive cardiomyopathy is a type of heart muscle disease where the heart muscle becomes stiff and cannot relax properly. This can lead to symptoms such as difficulty in filling the heart with blood during diastole (the relaxation phase of the heartbeat).\n\nEchocardiogram: An echocardiogram uses sound waves to create images of the heart's structure and function. It can show signs of restrictive cardiomyopathy, such as decreased filling of the ventricles and impaired relaxation.\n\nECG (Electrocardiogram): An ECG records the electrical activity of the heart and can detect abnormalities in the heart's rhythm. While it may not directly show restrictive cardiomyopathy, it can identify premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), which are extra heartbeats originating from the ventricles. PVCs can be associated with restrictive cardiomyopathy, but they are not specific to this condition.\n\nIf you are still confused after having multiple echocardiograms and ECGs, it is important to consult with your doctor. They may recommend additional tests, such",

I have never seen or heard him grind.\n\n### Response:Based on the description provided, it is possible that your son's jagged front teeth could be due to enamel deficiency or dental erosion. Enamel is the strongest substance in the human body and covers the surfaces of our teeth. It can be eroded or worn away over time due to various factors such as excessive acidity in the mouth, frequent exposure to hot or cold temperatures, or certain medical conditions.\n\nHowever, it is also important to consider another possibility - dental trauma. Grinding or bruxism (teeth grinding) can sometimes cause dental erosion and jagged edges on the front teeth. If your son has not been diagnosed with enamel deficiency or dental erosion by the dentists, it would be advisable to consult with a pediatric dentist who can evaluate his teeth and provide a more accurate diagnosis.\n\nIn the meantime, you can try to minimize the risk of further erosion by reducing your son's exposure to acidic foods and drinks, encouraging him to eat and drink from a cup rather than using a bottle or sippy cup, and ensuring that he brushes his teeth regularly with fluoride toothpaste.\n\nPlease note that this response is based on the limited information provided, and it is always best to consult with a health",

Drug Tolerance: Over time, the body may develop tolerance to a medication, requiring higher doses to achieve the same effect. This can happen with Fluoxetine as well.\n\n3. Underlying Conditions: It is also important to consider any underlying conditions or factors that may be contributing to your symptoms. Stress, changes in lifestyle, or other medications you may be taking could potentially impact the effectiveness of Fluoxetine.\n\nConsidering these possibilities, it would be advisable to consult with your prescribing doctor or psychiatrist.

My dentist said it is fine, but I am very worried as I have heard this antibiotic is very toxic. What is your advice concerning this issue, please?\n\n### Response:As a doctor, I can provide some guidance on the use of Levofloxacin in your case.\n\nLevofloxacin is commonly prescribed after dental procedures, such as sinus lift grafts and implant placement, to prevent infection. It belongs to a class of antibiotics called fluoroquinolones, which are effective against bacteria that can cause infections in the sinuses and surrounding tissues.\n\nThe high dose of Levofloxacin (500 mg every 12 hours) is often recommended to ensure adequate coverage and prevent potential complications. However, it is important to note that the combination of Levofloxacin with Ibuprofen and Dexamethasone should be avoided due to an increased risk of tendonitis and tendon rupture.\n\nIbuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can interfere with the effectiveness of Levofloxacin by reducing its ability to kill bacteria. Dexamethasone is an anti-inflammatory steroid that can also have similar interactions with Levofloxacin.\n\nInstead of combining Levofloxacin with Ibuprofen and Dexamethasone, it would be better to use alternative pain",

She lives in an area which does not have excellent medical facilities. Hence we thought to take your opinion. Please look at the attached X-ray, prescribed medicine, and let me know your views on the situation. Also, her bone density is extremely low, I do not have her last report, but when did three years ago, it came to be very low.The proposed diagnosis by the doctor, says minor fracture, and since it is in the hip area, plaster cannot be done. Currently, there is a stand provided to support and asked for complete bed rest. However, she is moving to use the washroom for stool. Please suggest if the course of treatment is fine and also how significant is the fracture.\n\n### Response:Based on the description provided, it seems that your mother has two fractures in the hip joints, one in the front and one in the back. The fact that she lives in an area without excellent medical facilities suggests that she may not be receiving the best possible care for her condition.\n\nI am an AI language model and not a doctor, but I can provide some general information. Hip fractures are serious injuries that can significantly impact a person's mobility and overall health. The treatment for hip fractures typically involves immobilization through the use of a cast, brace, or surgical implant such as a hip replacement.\n\nIn your case, since your mother's bone density is low and the fractures are minor, it may not be possible to use a cast or brace effectively. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional who can assess her specific condition and recommend the most appropriate treatment plan.\n\nIn terms of the current course of treatment, providing support with a stand and asking for complete bed rest may help to protect the fractures and allow for healing. However, since your mother is still able to move to use the washroom for stool, it seems that she may not be following the recommended restrictions. This could potentially compromise the healing process and increase the risk of complications.\n\nI would recommend reaching out to a healthcare professional in",

My due date based on LMP and ultrasound are different. Please answer. Also how many \"safe\" days are there after a period?\n\n### Response:To figure out your conception date, you can use the date of your last menstrual period (LMP) and add 9 months and 7 days. However, since your LMP was three months ago and you mentioned having a dating ultrasound, it is likely that your conception date can be determined more accurately using the ultrasound results.\n\nThe GA (gestational age) mentioned in the dating ultrasound is 9 weeks and 3 days. To calculate the conception date, you need to add 9 weeks and 3 days to the date of the ultrasound. So, your conception date would be around 26 weeks and 3 days after your LMP.\n\nAs for the due date, it is calculated based on the LMP and the duration of the pregnancy. Since your due date based on the ultrasound and LMP differ, it is possible that your pregnancy is not exactly 9 months long. In such cases, it is common to use the estimated date of confinement (EDC) instead of the due date. The EDC is usually around 40-42 weeks from the LMP.\n\nAs for the number of \"safe\" days after a period, it is important to use contraception until you have had a menstrual period and are certain that you are not pregnant.

I have been suffering from azoospermia and have been in touch with different doctors for the last eight to 10 months. I have done many tests and everyone is ending up with a suggestion of testicular biopsy. My wife is not in favor of this and both of us would like to go for other tests before going for a biopsy. I am attaching all the reports. Can you please let me know whether there is any hope of the sperm coming back?  Please suggest. I had four cycles of chemotherapy six years back and now I am completely cured.\n\n### Response:Based on the information provided, it seems that you have been experiencing azoospermia, which is the absence of sperm in the ejaculate. Azoospermia can have various causes, including previous chemotherapy treatment.\n\nThe suggestion of testicular biopsy is commonly made when other diagnostic tests fail to identify the cause of azoospermia. A testicular biopsy involves removing a small sample of testicular tissue for further examination under a microscope. This procedure is typically done under local anesthesia and has a relatively low risk.\n\nHowever, before considering a testicular biopsy, it is important to explore other options. In your case, it would be beneficial to discuss alternative tests with your wife and consult with a fertility specialist. They may suggest additional investigations such as hormonal assessments, imaging studies (such as ultrasound), or specialized tests like testicular sperm extraction (TESE) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). These tests aim to identify any potential sperm production or retrieval issues.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that the success rate of fertility treatments involving ICSI or TESE can vary depending on the underlying cause of azoospermia. In your case, since you had chemotherapy six years ago, it is possible that the sperm production may have been",

Based on the description you have given, it seems like the wound has successfully healed with the help of honey. However, it is important to note that Nocardia infection can sometimes require longer treatment duration compared to Staphylococcus aureus infections.\n\nRegarding the presence of Nocardia in your blood, it is possible for the bacteria to be present in your bloodstream during active infection. However, it is less common for the bacteria to persist in the blood after the infection has resolved. In most cases, the infection is localized to the site of entry, such as a skin wound.\n\nSince you have no symptoms and the wound has healed, it is unlikely that Nocardia is still present in your blood. However, I would recommend following up with the infectious disease specialist as scheduled to ensure that there are no complications or ongoing issues related to the infection.\n\nBefore your visit, there is no specific action you need to take. However, it would be helpful to provide the infectious disease specialist with a detailed history of the infection, including the initial presentation, treatment received, and the resolution of symptoms. This will allow the specialist to better understand your case and make appropriate recommendations.\n\nIt is always",

I have done a blood test, and I have a ferritin level of 10 ng/mL. After taking supplements, my ferritin got increased to 16 ng/mL. But, still, I suffer from weakness. My doctor advised me to have an iron infusion to raise my levels. I still have low energy, and it is affecting my daily life. Can I take an infusion now? Can it help me? Please suggest.\n\n### Response:Based on the information provided, it seems that you have a low ferritin level which indicates iron deficiency anemia. The supplements you took have helped increase your ferritin level, which is a positive sign.\n\nIron infusion is typically recommended for patients with severe iron deficiency anemia who are experiencing symptoms such as fatigue and weakness. Since you still have low energy despite the increase in ferritin levels, it may be appropriate for you to proceed with the iron infusion.\n\nIron infusions are administered intravenously and can quickly replenish your iron stores. This treatment is usually effective in improving energy levels and alleviating symptoms associated with iron deficiency anemia.\n\nHowever, it is important to consult with your doctor before proceeding with any medical treatment. They will evaluate your specific condition and determine if an iron infusion is necessary and appropriate for you at this time.",

Is there anything I can do?\n\n### Response:As a doctor, I would recommend the following steps to alleviate the pain caused by drinking cold stuff after getting a cavity filled:\n\n1. Take over-the-counter pain relievers: You can take acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) to reduce pain and inflammation.\n\n2. Rinse your mouth with saltwater: Mix half a teaspoon of salt in a glass of warm water and gently rinse your mouth several times a day. This can help reduce inflammation and relieve pain.\n\n3. Avoid cold drinks: It is advisable to avoid consuming cold or iced drinks until the sensitivity in your tooth subsides. Opt for warm or room temperature beverages instead.\n\n4. Use a straw: If you must drink cold drinks, using a straw can help minimize direct contact between the cold liquid and the filled tooth, reducing the potential for discomfort.\n\n5.

The fact that you had unprotected sex on Wednesday and took an Ipill on Thursday suggests that you may have ovulated and could be at risk of conception.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that even if sperm did enter your uterus, it is still possible to prevent pregnancy with the Ipill. The Ipill works by preventing ovulation and thickening the cervical mucus to block sperm from reaching the egg.\n\nTo determine if you are pregnant, I would recommend taking a home pregnancy test. If the result is positive, it means you are pregnant and should consult with a healthcare professional for further guidance. If the result is negative, it means you are not pregnant and your next period should arrive on the expected date.\n\nIt is always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and to address any concerns you may have.",

False positive pregnancy test: It is possible that the initial positive pregnancy test was due to a false positive result. This can occur if the test is performed too early after missed periods or if the hCG levels in the urine are elevated for another reason, such as a urinary tract infection or hormonal imbalance.\n\n2. Ectopic pregnancy: Another possibility is an ectopic pregnancy, where the fertilized egg implants outside of the uterus, usually in the fallopian tube. This can cause a positive pregnancy test but may not result in a viable pregnancy. An ectopic pregnancy can be life-threatening if left untreated, so it is important to seek medical attention promptly.\n\n3. Miscarriage: If you experienced a missed period and then had a positive pregnancy test, it is possible that you miscarried the pregnancy without realizing it. Miscarriages can occur early in pregnancy and may not always be accompanied by noticeable symptoms.\n\n4. Hormonal imbalance: Hormonal imbalances can also cause irregular menstrual cycles and missed periods. This could be due to factors such as polycyst",

But those two high readings could have just been because of the Seroquel because I have never had high readings like that other than when I was taking the Seroquel and I was taking a high dose. A lot of people only take 100 to 200 mg, but I was taking 800 mg. So, do you think I am a diabetic or do you think it was just the Seroquel that caused the two high readings?\n\n### Response:Based on the patient's description, it is possible that the high blood sugar readings experienced after taking Seroquel were due to the medication causing diabetes or high blood sugar. However, it is also important to consider other factors such as lifestyle, diet, and other medical conditions that could contribute to elevated blood sugar levels.\n\nTo determine whether the patient is a diabetic or if the high blood sugar readings were solely caused by the Seroquel, further evaluation is needed. I recommend consulting with a healthcare professional who can conduct a thorough examination, review the patient's medical history, and order any necessary tests to confirm the diagnosis.",

Vocal fry is characterized by a low, rough, or raspy voice quality. It is often associated with speaking in a monotone or mumbling.\n\nThe changes in your voice could be due to several factors. One possible reason is the surgery you had called septoplasty, which involves correcting nasal passages. After the surgery, if one nostril is still blocked or partially blocked, it can affect the airflow during speech, leading to the vocal fry sound.\n\nAdditionally, the way you breathe through your mouth instead of your nose may also contribute to the development of vocal fry.

No burning, just slight urethra burning. I went to a urologist. He told me nothing was wrong, maybe an overactive bladder. I go to the toilet every two hours or three. I never knew what was wrong, but I started to obsess over it and it got worse to a place that my mind is in urination 24/7.

Anxiety can cause increased sympathetic nervous system activity, which can lead to increased bladder activity and subsequently increased urine production. This can result in clear urine due to the lack of bacterial growth.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that there could be other underlying causes for the patient's symptoms as well.

So, I am a little confused about which sunblock cream to use. I need your suggestion on which cream to use. I do not understand the concept of SPF 25, 30, 50 and 60.\n\n### Response:As a doctor, I can provide you with some guidance on choosing the right sunblock cream.\n\nSPF stands for Sun Protection Factor, which indicates the level of protection against UVB (burning) and UVA (aging) rays provided by the sunscreen. The higher the SPF number, the longer it takes for your skin to burn. For example, an SPF of 25 means it takes approximately 25 times longer for your skin to burn compared to if you weren't wearing any sunscreen.\n\nHere are some recommendations based on your description:\n\n1. Choose a broad-spectrum sunscreen: Look for a sunscreen that protects against both UVA and UVB rays. This will provide better overall protection for your skin.\n\n2. Consider your skin type and sensitivity: If you have sensitive skin, you may want to opt for a hypoallergenic or fragrance-free sunscreen to minimize any potential irritation.\n\n3. Apply sunscreen generously: Remember to apply a thick layer of sunscreen to all exposed areas of your face, neck, and body. This will ensure adequate coverage and protection.\n\n4. Reapply sunscreen regularly: It is important to reapply sunscreen every two hours, especially if you are sweating or swimming, as these activities can reduce its effectiveness.\n",

Masturbation is a common practice and does not typically cause erectile dysfunction or other sexual issues in marriage. However, it is important to note that excessive masturbation can lead to certain complications.\n\nHere are a few potential concerns:\n\n1. Desensitization: Frequent masturbation can desensitize the penis, making it less responsive to sexual stimuli.

Topical treatments: Apply over-the-counter or prescription-strength topical creams or gels containing ingredients such as benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, or retinoids. These can help reduce inflammation and kill bacteria that contribute to acne.\n\n2. Oral medications: In cases where topical treatments are not effective or when there is a significant amount of acne, oral medications may be necessary. Common oral medications for acne include antibiotics (such as doxycycline or minocycline), hormonal therapies (such as combined oral contraceptives or spironolactone), or isotretinoin (Accutane).\n\n3.

It is important to determine the underlying cause before considering any treatment options. Some possible causes of unilateral ptosis include:\n\n1. Eye muscle weakness: Weakness in the muscles that control eyelid movement can lead to ptosis. This can be caused by conditions such as myasthenia gravis, oculomotor nerve palsy, or muscle weakness due to aging.\n\n2. Eye socket disorders: Conditions like orbital tumors, fractures, or inflammation of the eye socket (orbitalitis) can cause ptosis.\n\n3. Eye diseases: Certain eye diseases like glaucoma, cataracts, or eyelid skin conditions like blepharitis can contribute to ptosis.\n\n4. Neurological disorders: Conditions like Bell's palsy or nerve damage from stroke can result in ptosis.\n\nTo determine the cause of your ptosis, it is recommended to consult with an ophthalmologist.

While in hospital, she contracted C.diff and has had several recurring bouts with it. She has had a transplant and so far she is doing well with no recurrence. She also has a fistula near the rectum from an abscess. They put in a tube to keep it open and flowing. She has always had bouts of constipation and diarrhea for years before the accident. Her cognitive functions have been diminishing. One of my brothers is living with her and care taking her for full time.She is very weak, but can walk with the aid of a walker. Before the accident, she was fine. But, she may have shown a few signs of slight memory issues and balance prior to the accident as well. Our main issue right now is loose stools with some fecal incontinence. The doctor said that the fecal incontinence is because of a weak rectum that will not hold back fecal matter. Also, the fistula is always draining. When her stools are normal, she has good energy and cognitive function. When she has loose stools, she is very weak and can hardly stand or walk. Her cognitive function is a lot worse. She gets very confused about daily items and memory issues.We are looking for supplements to keep her regular and avoid the loose stool episodes. These are recurring every other week. Being so weak at the time of an episode, the toilet and the surrounding area get very filthy. She has little control and not able to clean herself properly. Her diet is pretty good. We are trying to keep dairy items away, limiting sugar and some carbohydrates as best as we can.We are giving her Metamucil when she has loose stools as well as some ammonium. This seems to have very limited success. She is on a blood pressure medicine as well as on Coumadin. So, we have to watch for interactions between everything. Regarding supplements, right now she is taking Alpha-GPC, Prevagen and multivitamins B for cognitive help, Fish oil, turmeric and Centrum multivitamins.Any help or suggestions to prevent the loose stools without creating constipation would be appreciated.

I am agitated that I may have a dry socket. On the third day, after the extraction, I have an increased pain on the extracted site.\n\n### Response:Based on the patient's description, it is possible that they may have a dry socket. Dry socket occurs when the blood clot that forms in the socket after a tooth extraction gets dislodged or dissolves prematurely. This can lead to increased pain and discomfort.\n\nTo confirm whether or not the patient has a dry socket, I would recommend examining the patient's mouth and taking a thorough history. The doctor may also perform a physical examination and possibly order an X-ray to assess the healing process.\n\nIf a dry socket is suspected, immediate treatment is necessary to prevent further complications. Treatment typically involves cleaning the socket, applying pain medication, and placing a dressing or packing to promote healing. In some cases, the doctor may also prescribe antibiotics to prevent infection.\n\nIt is important for the patient to follow up with their dentist or oral surgeon for a proper evaluation and treatment plan if they suspect they have a dry socket.",

These changes can be attributed to natural aging processes and sun exposure.\n\nTo address these concerns, non-invasive techniques such as topical anti-aging serums, facials, massages, and exercises can help improve the appearance of aging skin. However, it's important to note that these methods may not be sufficient to reverse or prevent further sagging of the cheeks.\n\nRetinol-A is a common ingredient found in many over-the-counter and prescription skincare products. It helps to stimulate collagen production, reduce inflammation, and improve the overall texture of the skin. It can be an effective treatment for reducing fine lines and wrinkles, but it may take several weeks or months to see significant results.\n\nIn terms of topical retinoids, vitamin C serums, and their effectiveness, it is true that many commercially available vitamin C serums tend to oxidize easily and do not penetrate the skin deeply. However, there are some formulations that have been stabilized to prevent oxidation and allow for better penetration. These formulations are generally more expensive but",

While some individuals may experience an increase in energy and motivation with Venlafaxine XR, others may not. If you are currently experiencing low energy and motivation, it may be beneficial to discuss this with your prescribing physician.

        "input": "Hi doctor,One year back, while sitting on a chair in office I felt as if my back got stuck and was unable to move. I took two painkillers and managed to sit there for a while, but after two to three hours the pain started radiating to leg. I was diagnosed with moderate disc herniation at L4-L5 and L5-S1. I was advised to take bed rest for three months and felt better after five months. Then I got some manipulation done with my lower back and my condition got worse. After that I had slight pain in my tail bone while walking and the pain got worse when I sit for five minutes. It got radiated to hips, thighs and it was worse when I stood up from a sitting position. Then I left with no option except bed rest for another four months that is a total nine months of bed rest. After that I suddenly started walking two to three hours a day in a stretch and started doing some exercises. After few days of getting my body too much into motion I felt my upper back getting stuck and again was unable to move and the pain radiated to my wrist and hand. Then had bed rest for another 10 days and felt a bit better. But, still in pain and resumed with two to three hours of brisk walking and exercises. I noticed that many joints in my body were making cracking sound while I walk or move my body and they were continuous. They are not going away no matter how much I move that joint, the cracking sound will repeat infinite times whenever I move my body. The cracking sound is mostly from lower and upper back, shoulder, ankle, foot fingers, knees also make that cracking sound and it is painful as well. Cracking sound in knees are felt more when I start walking after being in rest state and frequency of cracking sound reduces after walking for two to three minutes.I got my ESR and CRP checked. They are normal, but there is a slight increase in lymphocytes and RBC. Now, I have been suffering from this continuous cracking sounds and pain in almost all my joints for more than a month now. I also suffer from severe pain in tail bone area. Also suffers from some sensation loss (not persistent) in left side of my upper left leg, pain in groin area (but not anymore), pain in lower back and upper back.

I took two painkillers and managed to sit there for a while, but after two to three hours the pain started radiating to leg. I was diagnosed with moderate disc herniation at L4-L5 and L5-S1. I was advised to take bed rest for three months and felt better after five months. Then I got some manipulation done with my lower back and my condition got worse. After that I had slight pain in my tail bone while walking and the pain got worse when I sit for five minutes. It got radiated to hips, thighs and it was worse when I stood up from a sitting position. Then I left with no option except bed rest for another four months that is a total nine months of bed rest. After that I suddenly started walking two to three hours a day in a stretch and started doing some exercises. After few days of getting my body too much into motion I felt my upper back getting stuck and again was unable to move and the pain radiated to my wrist and hand. Then had bed rest for another 10 days and felt a bit better. But, still in pain and resumed with two to three hours of brisk walking and exercises. I noticed that many joints in my body were making cracking sound while I walk or move my body and they were continuous. They are not going away no matter how much I move that joint, the cracking sound will repeat infinite times whenever I move my body. The cracking sound is mostly from lower and upper back, shoulder, ankle, foot fingers, knees also make that cracking sound and it is painful as well. Cracking sound in knees are felt more when I start walking after being in rest state and frequency of cracking sound reduces after walking for two to three minutes.I got my ESR and CRP checked. They are normal, but there is a slight increase in lymphocytes and RBC. Now, I have been suffering from this continuous cracking sounds and pain in almost all my joints for more than a month now. I also suffer from severe pain in tail bone area. Also suffers from some sensation loss (not persistent) in left side of my upper left leg, pain in groin area (but not anymore), pain in lower back and upper back. Also a few days back a physiotherapist did some manipulation, which again increased my problem and after that when I wake up in morning both my hands are badly at asleep. Doctors say that discs are hydrated and it is rather some other thing which is causing me problems but are unable to diagnose.

Right now, I am taking only Vitamin D3 supplement. I am attaching all my reports for your reference.\n\n### Response:Based on the patient's description, it appears that they are experiencing symptoms of a condition called fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia is a chronic disorder characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and tenderness in certain areas of the body.\n\nThe patient's symptoms of joint cracking and pain, along with numbness and tingling sensations in the upper leg, are consistent with fibromyalgia. These symptoms can occur due to changes in the fluid content of the joints, which can lead to joint stiffness and inflammation.\n\nThe patient's weight gain and sedentary lifestyle may have contributed to the development of fibromyalgia. Weight gain can increase stress on the joints, while prolonged sitting and inactivity can further exacerbate muscle stiffness and pain.\n\nIt is important for the patient to consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and management plan. Treatment for fibromyalgia typically involves a combination of medication, physical therapy, exercise, and lifestyle modifications.",

However, an OCT showed nerve fiber thinning and ganglion cell thinning.\n\n### Response:Based on the patient's description, it is possible that they have angle-closure glaucoma. Angle-closure glaucoma occurs when the drainage angle of the eye becomes blocked, leading to increased pressure within the eye. This increased pressure can cause optic nerve damage and result in vision loss.\n\nThe patient's symptoms of decreased vision in the right eye after taking a strong sleeping pill called Trazodone, followed by worsening vision in the left eye three weeks later, are consistent with the acute angle-closure attack. The lack of improvement after three months suggests ongoing damage to the optic nerve.\n\nThe normal fundus and clinical examinations, along with the findings of nerve fiber thinning and ganglion cell thinning on OCT, further support the diagnosis of angle-closure glaucoma.\n\nIt is important for the patient to seek immediate medical attention to prevent further damage to the optic nerve. Treatment options for angle-closure glaucoma may include medication, laser therapy, or surgery to improve the drainage angle and reduce intraocular pressure.",

They are the same as that material that appears roughly along the bottom edges of my lower incisors. I think they are either tartar or cementum, but I do not know. Please let me know what you think they are and what my options are.\n\n### Response:Based on the description you provided, it is possible that the hard material that broke off from one of your teeth is either tartar or cementum. Tartar is a hardened plaque deposit that can form on the surfaces of teeth, while cementum is a hard, yellowish-white layer that covers the roots of teeth.\n\nIn terms of what you should do about it, if the material is indeed tartar, you can try to remove it yourself using a soft-bristled toothbrush and dental floss.

These tests can help evaluate the functioning of the heart during physical exertion and provide valuable information about the overall health of the heart.\n\nIt is important to follow your doctor's recommendations regarding the need for a nuclear stress echo.

What are the risks of pregnancy in women over 40?\n\n### Response:As a doctor, I can provide some information on your concerns.\n\nRegarding the possibility of having a vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) with your second pregnancy, it depends on various factors. The most important factor is the reason for your previous C-section. If it was due to non-medical reasons such as failure to progress or fetal distress, then there is a higher chance of attempting a VBAC. However, if your previous C-section was performed for medical reasons such as breech presentation or uterine rupture, then the likelihood of attempting a VBAC may be lower.\n\nIn general, the success rate for a successful VBAC is around 70-80%. It is important to discuss your medical history with your healthcare provider, who can evaluate your specific situation and provide personalized recommendations.\n\nRegarding the risks of pregnancy in women over 40, there are some increased risks compared to younger women. These include a higher chance of gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, placenta previa, and chromosomal abnormalities in the fetus.

However, if your previous C-section was performed for medical reasons such as breech presentation or uterine rupture, then the likelihood of attempting a VBAC may be lower.\n\nIn general, the success rate for a successful VBAC is around 70-80%. It is important to discuss your medical history with your healthcare provider, who can evaluate your specific situation and provide personalized recommendations.\n\nRegarding the risks of pregnancy in women over 40, there are some increased risks compared to younger women. These include a higher chance of gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, placenta previa, and chromosomal abnormalities in the fetus. However, it's important to note that many women over 40 have healthy pregnancies and deliveries.\n\nTo address your concerns and explore the options available to you, it is recommended to consult with a healthcare provider who"

About seven months ago, he had an episode of foreign body pain in the eye which the contact lens could not control. His optometrist changed the type of lens after remarking that the lens appeared tight. Although the painful sensations have decreased, they are still present with more of a sore feeling now. His ophthalmologist suggested that he discontinue the Azopt drops he had been using in case the preservative was causing some corneal toxicity. His eye pressure without the drops has read at 18 and 20 on separate occasions, but he does have corneal edema which may affect the measurement.

My query is that if the bandage lens has worked so well for pain management for 10 years is it possible that it can continue to work? And if the Azopt drops and their preservative had caused some toxic reaction seven months ago, could that still be causing him to feel the discomfort? His consultant suggested out that he could have the eye removed to control the pain, but as he has what he feels is some slight, useful vision in that eye, he does not want to take such a drastic and life-changing step.

The ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) is also elevated, indicating inflammation in the body.\n\nThe presence of an eye infection that has been clearing up could be a possible cause for the elevated WBC and ESR. However, it is important to consider other factors as well.\n\nGiven your symptoms of severe anxiety and the fact that you are isolated due to COVID-19, it is possible that your elevated WBC and ESR could be related to stress rather than an active infection. Stress can indeed cause inflammation and increase WBC count.\n\nTo determine the exact cause of your elevated WBC and ESR, further investigations may be necessary. These could include a reevaluation of your blood work, additional tests such as a throat swab or urine analysis, or even a physical examination.\n\nRegarding your concern about cancer, it is important to note that elevated WBC and ESR can be seen in certain types of cancers, but they are not specific markers for cancer. However, if your symptoms persist or worsen, it is advisable to consult with your doctor for further evaluation and appropriate management.\n\nPlease consult with your healthcare provider for",

My question is do I let it heal on its own or should I go see a doctor?\n\n### Response:Based on the description you provided, it seems like you have a ruptured eardrum. Ruptured eardrums can occur due to various reasons, including sudden changes in air pressure or trauma to the ear.\n\nIn most cases, ruptured eardrums heal on their own with proper care and no medical intervention is required. However, there are a few factors that may affect the healing process and determine whether you should see a doctor:\n\n1. Severity of the injury: If the eardrum is only slightly torn or if there is minimal bleeding, it may heal without any medical intervention. However, if the tear is large or if there is significant bleeding, you may consider seeking medical attention to prevent complications such as infection or hearing loss.\n\n2. Symptoms persisting for a long time: If your eardrum continues to leak fluid or if you experience severe pain or discomfort, it is advisable to seek medical attention. In such cases, a doctor can provide appropriate treatment options and prescribe medications to alleviate pain and reduce the risk of infection.\n\n3. Pre-existing medical conditions: If you have any pre-existing medical conditions such as diabetes, a weakened immune system, or a history of recurrent ear infections, it is important to consult a healthcare professional even if the",

I honestly do not understand the benefits of a ketone diet, what are they? Is a ketone diet good for those who are diabetic?\n\n### Response:A ketone diet is a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet that aims to increase the production of ketones in the body. Ketones are substances that are produced when the body breaks down fats for energy instead of carbohydrates.\n\nThe benefits of a ketone diet include:\n\n1. Weight loss: By reducing carbohydrate intake, the body enters a state of ketosis, where it starts using stored fats as fuel. This can lead to weight loss.\n\n2. Blood sugar control: A ketone diet may be beneficial for individuals with diabetes, as it helps to regulate blood sugar levels. When carbohydrates are limited, the body relies more on fat metabolism, which can improve insulin sensitivity and glycemic control.\n\n3. Increased energy levels: Ketones are a more efficient source of energy than carbohydrates, which can result in increased energy levels throughout the day.\n\n4. Improved brain function: Some studies suggest that a ketone diet may have positive effects on brain health and cognitive function, particularly in conditions like Alzheimer's disease.\n\nAs for diabetic individuals, a ketone diet can be beneficial as it helps to manage blood",

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.\n\n### Input:\nHi doctor,My wife is indifferent to child health issues. She controls the child with threatening words. The child cannot cry or weep even with an extreme reprimand by her. She makes the child sleep under extreme pressure. Sometimes, the child wets the bed. She then becomes furious with him. All this has led him to be a withdrawn child and always compromising. Please suggest me.\n\n### Response:Based on the description provided, it seems that your wife may be exhibiting signs of emotional abuse towards your child. This type of behavior can have long-term negative effects on the child's emotional development and overall well-being.\n\nI would strongly recommend seeking professional help from a mental health professional or a child therapist who can assess the situation and provide appropriate interventions. They will be able to guide you on how to address these issues and support your child's emotional needs.\n\nIn the meantime, it is important to create a safe and nurturing environment at home for your child. Encourage open communication between yourself and your child, and provide reassurance and love. It may also be helpful to seek support from family members or friends who can offer understanding and empathy.\n\nRemember, seeking professional help is crucial in order to effectively address the emotional abuse your child is experiencing and promote their overall well-being.",

        "input": "Hi doctor, I have been taking Effexor XR 300 mg for depression. It has been working really well. My psychiatrist has now prescribed me Strattera for ADHD. I am about to start 25 mg and work my way upto 80 mg over a few weeks. Strattera and Effexor both seem to inhibit Norepinephrine reuptake. Is it safe to take this combination? I know my psychiatrist knows what he is doing, but I wanted to get a second opinion from others.",

I know my psychiatrist knows what he is doing, but I wanted to get a second opinion from others.\n\n### Response:As a medical expert, I can provide some information on the safety of combining Effexor XR (venlafaxine) and Strattera (atomoxetine). Both medications inhibit the reuptake of norepinephrine, which is a neurotransmitter involved in mood regulation.\n\nIn general, there is no known significant interaction between Effexor XR and Strattera. However, it is important to note that individual responses to medications can vary. It is always recommended to consult with your prescribing physician or psychiatrist regarding any potential drug interactions or side effects.\n\nIt is common practice for healthcare professionals to review a patient's medical history, current medications, and any potential contraindications before prescribing any new medication. Your psychiatrist likely considered these factors when prescribing Strattera in combination with Effexor XR.\n\nIf you have any concerns or experience any adverse effects while taking these medications together, it is essential to communicate with your healthcare provider promptly. They will be able to assess your specific situation and make any necessary adjustments to your treatment plan.",
