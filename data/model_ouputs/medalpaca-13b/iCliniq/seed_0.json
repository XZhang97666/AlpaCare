It was my first time experiencing heartburn and I thought it was heart related. Went for X-rays and echo heart ultrasound. Everything came out fine. I have a healthy heart. What made the burning chest sensation go away temporarily is lying down, eating, exercising and drinking alcohol. And the weird part is the same thing helps me relieve my facial tightness temporarily is the same thing as that for the burning chest sensation; lying down, eating, exercising and drinking alcohol.Since having this facial tightness, I have paid numerous visits to different doctors, even the neuro-specialist and they all said it was anxiety. The doctors did facial senses test where they take a piece of fine cotton to touch different parts of my face. I had to close my eyes and tell them where the spot is. I have no troubles at all. I did blood test. It came out normal. They told me I do not need to do any scans and that it was merely anxiety and it will go off by itself. I convinced myself that I had anxiety because of the one month heartburn ordeal that I was suffering from. Even though the facial tightness was there, I tried my utmost best to ignore it. I do not think that I have any anxiety in me now as I try not to think of the weird tightness sensation. However, it has been 3 whole months and now I am getting alarmed and worried that it is still here and with newer sensations as I described above. In all honesty, I do feel that the intensity of the facial tension as compared to I first experienced it, is less. However, it is always there even as when I am typing this. I do not see any physical change on my body. Not sure if it is neuro damage. I am worried sick.Hope I can get some form of advice and diagnosis.",

In general terms, it was informed about TB in her abdomen. Accordingly, medicines were given to her as per the advise of a local MD doctor. Treatment continued for three months and due to some discontinuation of medicine it relapsed and again she was diagnosed with Thicken bowel loop as per USG. Again treatment continued.However, while undergoing treatment she lost sensation in her legs and complained of losing sensation in her legs and numbness in her feet and was unable to put on slippers in her feet with difficulty in moving. She also complained that while moving she felt as if she was moving on a bed of soft cotton.Subsequent treatment by neuro experts revealed that overdose of treatment of her TB in abdomen resulted in this condition and she was diagnosed for peripheral neuropathy and was advised for biopsy for proper diagnosis. Meanwhile, she fell and hurt herself which was later on diagnosed that her spine at L3 - L4 was compressed due to felling abruptly and accordingly she was advised to take bed rest for three months. Slowly, she recovered from this condition felt pain in her back and was facing another kind of problem as she could not sit for a longer time and preferred to lay down on the bed.Finding her bad condition subsequetly, we also took consultation from other neuro experts at a prestigious institution where she was prescribed Lupivitin one tablet and Sammy one tablet.When condition persisted thereafter she was given Primosa one tablet daily, Neurox one tablet daily, Maxglobin 50 mg one tablet and Defart 6 mg.But, whenever she was given medicine her condition further aggravated.

If you have any neurological problem then you should consult a neurologist. You have mentioned that your mother was treated by local MD doctor, but I would like to know whether she was treated by a neurologist. She should be treated by a neurologist as she has loss of sensation in her legs. Primosa, Maxglobin (steroid) and Decadron (steroid) are also not proper treatment. Your mother was hospitalized, but her neurological problem is not proper treated. She should be treated by a neurologist. Definitely she should be investigated for spinal cord compression. I would like to know whether she has any pain in her back. Thanks.",

He was with someone who now has heart palpitations, sweaty palms and feet, and lightheadedness sitting in the living room. We ran a battery of tests when it first happened including TSH, EKG, lung scans, blood panels, etc. and everything was normal. So we went down the path of anxiety. Four years later, the symptoms continued. As my son now has a terrible fear of doctors, we tried a home blood test to get a full thyroid panel. I have attached the results.The blood work came back normal. Low normal TSH, but low normal T4 and lower normal free T4 and free T3. There is nothing that shows an abnormality. However, his urine test showed moderately low iodine and slightly low selenium. I have read that abnormalities in these measures could cause thyroid problems. What am I wondering is if these two indicators are worth further exploration with an endocrinologist knowing that going to the doctor will cause my son a severe panic.Also, is it possible that low iodine could have been a temporary diet thing and it is masking the signs of hyperthyroidism in the blood work?

She did not consult a rheumatologist yet. What medication can I give to reduce the inflammation and cure her? Her ESR, CPR, and ANA are quite high. The pain in her hands and the tingling in her legs at night are agonizing her life. Kindly provide your expert advice.\n\n### Response:Hi, Consult a neurologist. Kindly evaluate her. There is no medicine to cure it, but evaluation is must.",

        "input": "Hello doctor,Just two days ago I found out I was about 1-2 weeks pregnant. And it has been about 4 1/2 weeks since my last menstrual period. Unfortunately with labor day being this weekend I have been unable to see my regular OBGYN. But I did go to the ER to confirm the pregnancy 2 days ago. So my blood results came back with an HCG OF 248 and the doctor said I am right around 1-2 weeks.So, here is my question. I have been stressing out badly due to the fact I have been on Lorazepam 1 mg every night for anxiety and PD for the last 2 years as well as Percocet 10 mg as needed for back pain. I have been taking both of the medications during my pregnancy when I had no idea I was pregnant. Since finding out I have tried tapering on both medications. The Percocet is making me sweat and very agitated and when I tried to cut down on the Lorazepam I was shaking and almost hallucinating and delusion. I also tried not taking the Lorazepam at all and woke up crying, shaking and sweating. I want to be off both these medicines but I am worried more about the Lorazepam as it is a class D pregnancy drug. I have read about the terrible problems this causes for infants. I am so scared that I am considering abortion. I do not want to be a terrible mother before I even give birth. I have been having bad panic attacks over this and cannot seem to relax as the complications of these medicines are always on my mind. Any advice at all would be very much appreciated.",

I do not agree with him on the ablation due to recent medical studies on WPW and how ablation is recommended even for asymptomatic patients, especially athletes.My question is regarding Flecainide. I have not had any palpitations since I began taking it a few days ago, but I want to make sure this drug is not putting me at risk for creating a dangerous rhythm. Reading case studies and medical journals, it seems there is some risk. I have not been known to go into AF, and besides palpitations, I am asymptomatic with WPW. Do you think Flecainide at this dosage is safe and reasonable for the next two weeks, until my ablation?",

I do not have any structural or plumbing heart issues. I have been diagnosed with WPW accidentally, and I am waiting for an ablation in 17 days. I am mostly asymptomatic, and I never had any extremely rapid heart rates. My resting heart rate is actually in the 40\\s. However, I do sometimes get palpitations and every once in awhile get a run of 5 to 7 in a row. The EP I saw in the hospital prescribed me Flecainide 50 mg, twice daily. I saw another EP, who was a much older guy, as a second opinion. He seems to think I do not need the Flecainide, and maybe not even the ablation.

Do you think Flecainide at this dosage is safe and reasonable for the next two weeks, until my ablation?\n\n### Response:Hi, I am Chat Doctor, I have read your query and understand your concern. There is no need of undergoing ablation as you are asymptomatic. So take Flecainide as prescribed and be careful for any symptoms like palpitations, shortness of breath etc. It is important to mention here that Flecainide is good for preventing the dangerous arrhythmias. It is good to take this medicine regularly as it prevents the dangerous arrhythmias. There is no need to go for ablation. You can ask your query again to me. I will be happy to help you. Thanks",

The thing I am scared about is, my doctor asked me why my ferritin has not increased (just the opposite, it has decreased from 5.79 to 5.77) after three months of taking iron supplements. My other iron levels are at 39 which has increased considering those references. But, that was probably because I did not use the medicine correctly, I was only taking 5 mg a day. Another thing I am worried about is, my lymphocytes kind of got increased in my blood: (52.8) - the reference is 19.4 to 44.9, and the other one is 3.57. My neutrophils kind of decreased too (36.9) and the reference was between 41.0 to 73.0.In the last week, I had a viral infection as both my parents were sick. Is it why my levels got high? My WBC is 6.77 and RBC is 4.52. My hemoglobin is also increasing actually, last time I checked, it was 11.0 and now it is 11.2. Still low, but it was good to see that it was increasing.

Anemia is a condition in which body cells are unable to produce enough red blood cells which results in decreased hemoglobin level. There are many causes of anemia like iron deficiency, infection, chronic disease etc. You should investigate the cause of anemia like is it due to less diet, less green leafy vegetables, less meat intake etc. You should take green leafy vegetables like spinach, fenugreek etc. which are rich in iron. You should take iron supplements as prescribed by your doctor. Thanks.",

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.\n\n### Input:\nHello doctor,I am a 31-year-old male with a history of closed globe injury in the right eye 10 years ago. At that time, my vision in the right eye was hand movements only and I was diagnosed with a macular injury. Three months later, my vision slowly improved to 6/36. However, my right eye started to deviate (exotropia) and I started experiencing diplopia. My main problem is diplopia. I have used prisms, but of no use. When I try to focus on an image, I have severe diplopia. The diplopia disappears when I try to correct the squint. At present, I am doing higher studies and the diplopia is really bothering me. Will doing a squint surgery be of any use? Is there anything that I can try?\n\n### Response:Hello, Thanks for writing to Chat Doctor. I went through your query. Your symptoms suggest that you have some problem in your right eye, most probably a muscle or nerve problem. I would suggest you to see an eye specialist. He will examine your eye and do the needful investigation. Hope I have answered your query. If you have any further query, please feel free to ask me. I will be happy to help you. Wish you good health. Thanks.",

        "input": "Hi doctor,I have a lower wisdom tooth that has been infected chronically for well over a year. I also have an upper molar that is broken decayed and has been like this for years. The wisdom tooth oozes green pus if you apply pressure with a cotton swab. The decayed tooth is mildly painful. I saw my dentist a few days ago, who did not seem overly concerned. She slightly cleaned the gums around the wisdom tooth and prescribed me Cephalexin and sent me on my way. I have been taking Cephalexin for a few days, and yet the tooth is still oozing. My throat is red and irritated, the gums inflamed and there is no swelling in the mouth. Also, my nostril on that side is tender and painful. I am severely worried about the infection spreading to either my heart or my brain. In fact, I read an article a few days ago about a 26 year old who died from a tooth infection spreading.I do not have a fever. I have mild nausea. It is tender on that side of my jaw. The dentist had said the next thing she could give me was Clindamycin, but I have a fear of the side effects of that medicine. I already have heart problems and mild stomach issues. I have read that Clindamycin can cause severe gastrointestinal problems and arrhythmias. She also suggested Zithromax, but I have had heart palpitations while on that medication as well. I am having the teeth removed by an oral surgeon in two weeks, but am afraid of dying from infection before then. What are my options? What is the best course of action? Are there other antibiotics for this? Am I dying from the infection already? Any of your advice or help is appreciated. My other possibly relevant health history is as follows: I have high blood pressure, tachycardia, high cholesterol and mild PVC\\s. I had a MRSA infection in my arm 10 years ago. I have many strep throat infections every year and frequent sinus issues. Also, I would like to mention that when I took smoothed Cephalexin capsule with a sip of water, I got a random salty taste in my mouth.",

I went to a gastroenterologist, who did a colonoscopy and found that I had an anal fissure and internal hemorrhoid. He prescribed Sitcom Forte, Eldicet, Velgut, and Pankreoflat. He also gave me Sucralcoat Ano cream. However, every night I was in too much pain. So, early this year, I decided to consult an Ayurveda doctor who gave me some Kashayams and tablets. However, my pain did not subside. I used to evacuate the stools using my fingers. That eliminated the stools, but there was so much mucus released and extreme pain after motion. Two months ago, I went to a GP who gave me some antibiotics and painkillers for five days. During this time, I was always sleepy. I took leave from work and was always tired and fatigued. Earlier this month, I went to another GI specialist who did a sigmoidoscopy and said that it is SRUS. He said that I should not finger evacuate the stools and gave me liquid paraffin and LoX cream. Now, my current situation is that it has been three days and I am very constipated and fatigued. The pain has subsided a little. However, I am not passing stools as I used to before. After I drink water or eat something, I get a vomiting sensation. I get anxiety and panic attacks as I am scared about my condition and do not know which doctor I should consult and what I should do. Is this condition serious and life-long? Will I ever be cured? Please advise on the correct medications (allopathy or ayurveda), lifestyle changes and other things to take care.",

I have gone through your query. As you have mentioned that you are suffering from constipation since long time. It may be due to some pathological cause. You should go for investigations to detect the cause. I would suggest you to go for investigations like blood, stool routine examination, ultrasound of abdomen, CT scan of brain, upper GI endoscopy. You should take plenty of water and fiber diet, do regular exercise and avoid straining. If your symptoms do not improve, you should consult a physician. I hope that my advice will help you. Take care.",

I have my exams tomorrow which I have to get to and other events on the weekend where I have to be (and will involve walking). I am worried about how I can see as I cannot walk at all.

If you have tight calf muscles it can be due to injury or overuse. You can take rest for 4-5 days and can apply diclofen gel locally. Deep tissue massage will help you to relax the muscles. Thanks.",

I am not sure if it is food or scar tissue because when I tried to get it out with a toothpick, it did not come out very easily, so I left it alone. Is this food or scar tissue? It is mildly bothersome.I brush my teeth but know to be careful around the surgical sites so they do not get irritated. It seems like a lot of plaque builds up back there because of this, and I am not quite sure what to do. Also, there is a very small spot of red gums on the front side of my second molar. I put a bit of mouthwash on it with a toothpick and left it alone.I have two questions, what is the whitish stuff that feels like food trapped in my healing gum socket?

Initially, as suggested by the hospital pediatrician, they were given Dexolac Special Care, but after 20th day when their weight was around 2.4 Kg, they were given to Dexolac Premium 1. Out of the 2 babies, the weaker baby is responding well and quickly gaining weight (taking around 75 ml milk every 3 hours). But the baby which was born stronger is not drinking sufficient milk (45 ml in one feed, at an interval of around 3 hours), and is taking around an hour to take one feed. Also, she is having issues of gas and constipation. Because of constipation, she keeps crying. Now, this baby is not gaining weight and seem to be weaker.

It lasts a second or two but may repeat several times before stopping in five minutes or so. I went out in the garden today to dig a bit and wearing my HR monitor (I have got health anxiety, anxiety disorder as well as depression). As I was digging, the pain started hurting with each heartbeat. I looked at my monitor and it read 138 bpm. I am 70 years old and have been on medication (Benzodiazepines) for over 50 years for panic attacks and general anxiety. Two years ago I felt similar pain but not to this extent. I went to ER but nothing was found (the doctor said it could be costochondritis but definitely not my heart). I get bloodwork quarterly and everything was fine except cholesterol which was 235. I tried a statin but the muscle pain was too great. In my EKG I have RBBB or LAFB which 14 years back after a stress test I was told that I was probably born with it. I had gone to see the cardiologist then because of getting skipped beats and GERD he told me to ignore them. Last time I had an EKG was in the ER for six months when I had a weird pain in back and side. They checked out heart anyway and said it was fine. Probably just a colicky gallbladder. I have had stones for more than 20 years and had no surgery. So I hesitate to go to the ER again. My local doctor just closed. HR is still 88 while lying down right now.

It may be due to some neurological cause or due to some stressful situation. Don't worry. I would suggest you to please visit a neurologist once and get examined. He will examine you and will give some medicines and advice accordingly. You may also take some medicines like risperidone or haloperidine which will help to control the abnormal sensations. Thanks.",

I have MRI and hysteroscopy photos to provide. I have had two missed miscarriages, the last one hemorrhaged two days before going septic and sent me to the ER for five days. I have also been diagnosed with a placental site nodule on my right side where both pregnancies have been. Could my problem be surgically corrected?Currently, we are going through genetic, blood clotting disorder, and menstrual cycle/hormone monitoring. Genetic counselor said low risk for any genetic causes but is still waiting to complete the blood tests which should be done in four weeks, same for the blood clotting tests.\n\n### Response:Hi, I had gone through your question, low risk of having blood clotting disorder, and I also have a question mark (?) on my screen. What does that mean?",

I do not know what to do, and I want to stop this imaginary life. How do I stop this imaginary life and love? I know this man is not real, and whenever my imaginary life becomes sad, it has an influence on my real life. I currently take tablet Levebel 500 mg, two tablets a day.\n\n### Response:Degree in psychology will help you to solve your problem.",

I have two questions. First I have noticed that my performance is erratic as in there are times when I can last 5-6 minutes and then the very next day it can go to 30-35 minutes. It is different with different partners. Second and more alarming is that I have been experiencing a stinging pain in my scrotum on the left side it usually happens when I stand up while sitting or laying and sometimes while walking. I tried finding the source of the pain by pressing in different regions but could not find one. Also, it happens at the back side of the scrotum. It is limited to the left side and has been increasing with each passing day. I thought of UTI, but my pee does not burn. Can I have some suggestions for my problems? Thank you.\n\n### Response:Hello, Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I went through your description, and I have some suggestions for you.1. You should do some yoga exercises, and some simple breathing techniques.2. Take some antibiotics, and some anti-inflammatory medicines.3.

It is white color although, the one on the top started to have a slight pink color. But the second one on the bottom which is much smaller still has completely white color and around the vagina blades, I have a little while dots. Also, there are very tiny warts line along the blades. So, when I went to see the GP near my house he had a look and said that there is nothing to worry it is still small. But in my opinion, I think it is quite big. So the doctor gave me a prescription for Condyline paint which he told me to use for three days only per week and I have to keep using it for three weeks and if it does not get better he told me to see him again. Now I have a few questions. Is this mean I have an HPV virus inside my body? How can I make the virus go away permanently? Will Gardasil injection make it go away? If it does not go away permanently, how can I make sure that I have no HPV viruses and so these warts will not come back again? Is this mean that I have this HPV from my boyfriend? How to use Condyline paint correctly? I wash my vagina blades and use the cotton pads to dry it, then I use start to use the Condyline paint. I only dip the swab once into the reagent and then I open my vagina blades so that I am able to paint the two warts inside my vagina as much as I can. Then I paint it all over the very tiny warts in the vagina blades area. Am I doing it correctly?Now I have been using the Condyline for two days, but the very tiny warts that are around the vagina blades started to grow more. Is this mean anything? Can condoms prevent these HPV viruses? If I break up with my boyfriend, will this help my symptoms and health to become better? I am very scared of whether this can leads to cancer? I do not want this to ever happen to me again, how can I prevent this to happen again?If my warts are gone can I have sex with my boyfriend? Will these symptoms comeback again?

Here is my question constant heart palpitations and fluttering, continuous feeling of adrenaline rushing along with palpitations very bad at night but also during the day when sitting in doing nothing palpitations often make you feel nauseous on a 1 to 10 scale they are about an eight. All labs are normal ECG, echo, and Holter monitor are all normal.Doctor cannot figure it out and prescribed Propranolol 10 mg, told me to try these once a day. Yesterday after doctor visits heart palpitations for four hours got fed up and took one tablet one hour later, all palpitations and adrenaline rush was gone. Slept for the first time without being woke up having to cough to stop the palpitations. Had angio done approximately two years ago due to suspected heart attack or arrhythmia at home with all classic signs crushing chest pain jaw neck left arm down to the floor nauseated?Even with that lab test came back good the next day. Had carotid artery surgery two years ago to remove a piece of plaque in right carotid artery none found anywhere else no stent needed. Again all labs are good cholesterol not high on statins and warfarin. I must be perplexing to all doctors because they cannot figure it out. Was put on warfarin approximately 15 years ago due to DVTs as a result of a surgery, always therapeutic. So I had a heart attack or arrhythmia a few years back the angio came out the great doctor said everything looked fine now I have these crazy heart palpitations that would not stop.

I had two debridement surgeries and was discharged after 5 days. I was treated with about 4 IV antibiotics. I do not remember them all, I recall seeing Vancomycin and Penicillin. I was told that the infection was not MRSA, but a \"slower moving bacteria\" they did not tell me what it was. I was swabbed for MRSA in my nose and butt before both surgeries and was told I did not have it. For the last day of my stay, I had a roommate who had a bad MRSA infection on her butt and sometimes had diarrhea incontinence during dressing changes. I had no physical contact with her, but we had the same nurse. I was discharged with a five day course of Augmentin.The wound has been healing very well and has not gotten infected, but three weeks after discharge I got an abscess under my arm. I went to an urgent care and was prescribed Clindamycin and told to return in three days for drainage. The abscess did not improve or get worse over the three days. I got it drained and was prescribed Augmentin and told to also continue the clindamycin. That was a week ago and the wound is healing well. They called today and said cultures show it was MRSA and they prescribed Bactrim and told me to stop the other antibiotics.I am feeling devastated by this and wanting to understand why it happened. Could I have gotten it in the hospital? I am concerned that it will not go away. Are those swabs at the hospital conclusive and mean for sure I did not have MRSA a month ago?

If you have any symptoms like fever, cough, breathlessness, you should immediately visit to the emergency because you are at risk of developing MRSA. Augmenting is also one of the most effective antibiotics to treat the MRSA. I would like to suggest you to take the Augmenting at least 3 times a day and follow the breathing instructions. Hope this helps.",

It is unfortunate that your father is not able to remember the incident which happened before three months back. It may be due to the accident which happened in the brain. That accident might have caused the memory loss. He requires neurological consultation. He needs to be hospitalized and taken care.",

It has been almost three weeks since I stopped Lyrica, Pregabalin completely for back pain.

I have been crazily searching to see if this is a result of any swollen lymph node fearing cancer but I could not find anything out of the ordinary on the body.

The weirdest thing is today I woke up with this sensation and I could feel heaviness behind my ears.This has come after an acute sinus infection, cough, night sweats (for which I had to take antibiotics) that hit me when I started tapering off Lyrica last month. I have had chronic sinus issues in the past too but this one was different, never had it progress to this level. I have uploaded an image of where exactly the pain or pressure originates but right now the pain or pressure is pretty spread out randomly across the neck.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.\n\n### Input:\nHi doctor,I have flaky skin on my scalp. My doctor told me it is sebopsoriasis. The flaking is limited to the scalp, and my doctor has prescribed Folitrax 5 mg and Aprezo 30 mg. I am having this problem for about four to five years. I am able to control flaking in the scalp by washing with shampoo but, it reoccurs after a day with hair loss. Can it be controlled? Or can it spread to other parts of the body?\n\n### Response:Hello, Thank you for asking your query on Healthcare. I can understand your concern regarding hair loss on scalp. It can be controlled by medication like Minoxidil 5% which is a non-surgical treatment. Minoxidil is an anti-fungal treatment which can stop the hair loss and prevents the hair from falling. You can also apply Lotion Amine which is a non-surgical treatment for hair loss on the scalp. It prevents the hair from falling and spreading to other parts of the body. It also prevents the formation of DHT. Treatment takes 4-5 months to show the results. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.",

Night: Clozapex 25 mg half a pill, Mirtimash 30 g half a pill, Depakine Chrono 500 mg one pill, and Anafranil 75 mg half a pill.I used to take more but I stopped them over the past two years. For example, I used to take double the mentioned dose about nine months ago. I recovered from depression a couple of months ago. I started detoxing but with my doctor, the process was going way too slow and I have gained 45 kilograms over the past two years (25 in the past two months alone!) my muscles, my bones, and my joints started to hurt really bad because of my weight. Nothing works. I go to the gym every day, I workout but still I eat way too much because of the drugs and I cannot control it. My doctor does not want me to stop despite every hardship that I face and even refuses to decrease half a pill from the prescription. However, three weeks ago, I decided to cut all medications once and for all. I lost 7 kilograms, I stopped eating too much and just by cutting down the drugs I saved not less than 1800 calories per day. I started going to the gym more regularly. But here is the problem.Clozapex 25 and Mirtimash make me sleep and without them, I cannot sleep. No kidding, I have not slept in the past three weeks more than a maximum of 70 hours. Even those 70 hours, they are full of nightmares and I usually wake up after two hours with my mind confused and afraid and I cannot sleep back. I want to sleep. My eyes grew tired because I have been opening them for way too long. I do not want to give in and get back to the drugs because I am sick of them and I have had enough. I am not going back but I also want to sleep. Just a single continuous eight hours of sleep without any nightmares. I usually get nightmares that are very weird. I do not even know how to describe them. Mathematical problems and complicated solutions that are presented to me (in my sleep) and I keep thinking about them until my head hurts and I wake up freaked out. Please tell me what to do. I thought that after three weeks it would get easier but it is not getting easier. I have no side effects at all from any of the drugs only the disturbance of sleep. Some of them were written on them that if you would stop them suddenly you would risk getting seizures but nothing happened thankfully. I am not even depressed or sad I am just irritated and sad about the sleeping problem.",

Clozapine is an effective medication which helps to reduce the risk of seizures. So it is very important to take this medication as prescribed by your doctor. Do not stop the medication without consulting your doctor. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if you have any further questions.",

He takes baby food and homemade food, which we also consume. His height, weight, and head circumference are normal.\n\n### Response:Hi...your child Chat Doctor.  Your child is suffering from constipation. Hard stool is a natural phenomenon, and it happens to every child. You should take care to give him plenty of fluids, and also give him fiber food, and also give him baby food. He will recover soon. Thank you.",

It can reduce blood pressure and heart rate. It also improves general mood. Licorice affects the levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that helps to regulate mood and anxiety. So, it is better to take it for a few days and then stop its use. I suggest taking it again after consulting your doctor.",

So, I thought I would consult with you on another question pertaining to my son. Unfortunately, a combination of my health anxiety and the big mistake of searching online has my mind imagining the worst with regard to my son. My son is 19 years old and has no diagnosed medical issues. I noticed back when he was about eight or ten years old that he had a mark resembling a cafe au lait mark on his back, in the upper shoulder area. I had always asked the pediatrician to look at it during his yearly physicals, and they made nothing of it. Throughout the years it has grown a bit and has become darker and more rough in texture. It is probably slightly less than an inch in length and looks like a few small lesions grouped together. Again, I have brought it to the pediatrician\\s attention and he was not concerned. Three months ago, I made an appointment for him and my other son with a dermatologist for a skin exam, and I pointed out the spots which I wanted to be checked in particular. We met with the physician\\s assistant there, and my younger son had a peculiar spot I pointed out, of which the PA conducted a shave biopsy, which came back as a mildly atypical junctional nevus. For my older son, I pointed out the spot on his back/shoulder, and the PA diagnosed it as a linear epidermal nevus. She said the chances of it becoming dangerous are slim to none. It may darken throughout the years, and they will simply monitor it at yearly visits. Unfortunately, I went on to research online about epidermal nevi and of course I ran into information showing a possible link to epidermal nevus syndrome and all of its associated neurological and skeletal defects. As I said, he is 19 and has no medical issues, is extremely intelligent, etc. In your opinion, is it safe to say that I should not be concerned about those syndromes? I presume it is primarily related to the numerous and systemic epidermal nevi, which he does not have, and I would think it would have presented by now? And my last even more neurotic question. My online research led me to some information saying that a certain type of epidermal nevus could be related to a gene mutation that could be passed along to an offspring, with them having possible serious skin scaling conditions, etc. Again, he has just one solitary small epidermal nevus. No biopsy was done, as the PA did not feel it was necessary. Do you feel there is any need for me to worry about that potential genetic mutation? Thank you so much for reading my long query.",

She had unhygienic sex a couple of weeks ago. She started feeling itchy on her vagina. I am worried it might be herpes but I need confirmation from a specialist before we visit the doctor. It looks clustered and yellow. No hard lump under and it just looks inflamed. She does not complain of pain anywhere else. There is no pain inside the urethra, no burning sensation while urinating and the discharge is whitish-yellowish and watery. She does not have any sign of fever. She bought labia herpes cream yesterday. After application it changed the color today to darker yellow and some of it fell off. What could this be?\n\n### Response:Hi, Your sister has been diagnosed with clustered yellow discharge. This could be a simple vaginal infection. She needs to be examined by a gynecologist to rule out any underlying problem.",

I was also having weird headaches, but that has subsided. I have been to several doctors and had blood work, oxygen level test and pulmonary test. Everything came back normal. With my breathing, I have the constant urge to take a deep breath in hopes of getting that satisfying deep sigh. I am constantly thinking about my breathing, even when I sleep. I am still able to exercise vigorously, run long distances, etc., with no problems. My fear is that I am experiencing diaphragm weakness as a result of something neurological. Here are my questions.

Priligy is an oral medication used for the treatment of overactive bladder.

I feel fatigue and dizzy for past one year. I slept very late one night and the next day while taking class had a dizzy feeling for a second. I felt that my head was reeling and on that afternoon I took off. It did not happen again but I felt myself weak with less energy, as if I am about to fall if I do not sit somewhere. I was unable to stand or walk for a longtime because of fatigue and lack of energy. Nerves were twitching sometimes.I saw several doctors but I was unable to convey my symptoms properly. Sometimes, I get a sudden panic too, with increased heartbeat, dizziness, etc., with a frightful feeling that something is going to happen. An MRI scan was done which is alright. Hypertension, thyroid, and sugar tests were done and that too fine. The doctor said it may be a stress reaction and he gave a tablet for fatigue. After having that tablet for a while, fatigue was gone, but other symptoms of panic attack, occasional tiredness still continues. Please help.\n\n### Response:Hello!My name is Chat Doctor. I have been suffering from dizziness and fatigue since one year. I took one Alprazolam 0.5 mg at night and that helped me a lot. Now I am feeling better. Thank you.",

You can do some Yoga and meditation also. It will be helpful for you. Thanks.",

There seems to be no difference when comparing the test in both knees.\n\n### Response:Hello, I am almost three months post-op after ACL reconstruction. I have been feeling some pain in the knee since the surgery, but I am not sure if I ruptured my ACL again. It has been three days since the surgery, and I am just wondering how accurate the Lachman test is when compared to the original.",

I consulted my general practitioner on the fourth or fifth day who prescribed some medications. I started feeling better after the seventh day and the throat improved.

Nevertheless, around 1 month after this resolved totally as said above, since yesterday I have started feeling same common cold symptoms, runny nose (not sneezing or coughing much though) with uneasiness in the palate, no raised body temperature but little feverish with mild body ache here and there.In both the aforesaid cases I had taken a Cetirizine tablet on the same day (but little later in the day) the symptoms started.

But maybe depression? I have not been able to think myself to be turned on. I have tried Zinc, Magnesium ZMA vitamin supplements which seemed to help for one week and I got hard morning erections. However, it stopped working. I have also tried Ginseng which does work as well as Tadalafil prescription works too. I can stimulate the penis with no medication too and ejaculate, but I usually have to look at porn (which I do not do often do because I have no libido, whatsoever). I have failed to have sex with three girls now because of lack of desire. I want to physically get it up, but it does not get up. I have ED, and I simply cannot get it up to beautiful women which is horrible.I have slight pain in both testicles which is I think because I have not masturbated.

No STDs of which I am sure because I had only five partners of which my ex-wife now was for last four years. All were protected sex. All tests came back normal.

Upon doing several laboratory tests, TSH was okay, PTH was low, vitamin D levels were fine and wrist X-ray was normal. The boy cannot walk and does not look as if he will soon. When standing, he bends his legs at knee point and also clenches his fists when grasping. From the looks, he seems okay. Please help.\n\n### Response:Hello, I understand your concern.

I have had folliculitis before in the same area and it was much different. She is the doctor. So I accepted and moved on. One small spot that has some hair growing back, small thin white hair. Yesterday, I noticed what appeared to be a bald spot in my pubic hair above the penis. When I trimmed the hair back, it revealed a quarter sized bald spot and a smaller dime sized spot. I am not sure how long they may have been there as they were somewhat masked by a longer pubic hair. So, now I have what I believe to be three spots, two below abdomen and one on beard. My concern is more of them spreading than the current spots.I am now thinking back about the annual checkup that I had with my GP six months back. I advised him that in the past year the amount of semen I produce has gone down drastically. I thought it may be a testosterone issue. He advised it was likely a result of my vasectomy the year before. Also as a part of my visit, my WBC was lower than normal, outside of the range by a couple. He was not concerned about that either.My question is whether any of these things are related: decrease in semen, low WBC, and alopecia in pubic area or all separate issues? I see no reason to go back to the dermatologist as my new spots are hidden. Based on these separate facts, is there any likelihood they are related and is there any reason to see a doctor?",

But, I am hesitant and kind of rejecting to do so.After a month, the nail is not loose anymore, but the nail seems to be growing outwards, and between the nail and the nail bed, there is a gap (kind of like a hollow gap inside).

        "input": "Hi doctor,I am a 23 year old male, a third-year medical student. For the past seven days, I have had an increased urgency and frequency to urinate. I can go even more than 30 times a day - majority of these times, I feel an increased urgency. However, when I go, only a small amount or drops come out. For the past two to three days, the urgency kind of feels to be getting worse, I feel as if I will not be able to hold it. However, I am still able to as there is no leaking. There is no burning or irritation or any discharge. No recent sexual encounters and no other associated symptoms. I take Coveram 10/10 for essential hypertension and Valdoxan 25 because I also do suffer from anxiety. I have been under stress lately as I was doing my exams this past week and finished today. I have done a few tests at my family doctor: Last week I did a dipstick which was normal apart from +1 protein. Voiding bladder US was normal (450 mL pre voiding, 45 mL post voiding). An initial urine culture was normal according to my doctor. Yesterday, I performed another dipstick and urine culture. The dipstick was normal, and early urine microscopy showed 10 to 100 white cell count. We are waiting for the cultures to return. Due to the result of the white cell count, my doctor said it would be worth a try to undergo a 5-day course of antibiotics (Keflex).Today is my third day of antibiotic treatment, symptoms are largely the same. Today, I attempted to hold my bladder. It felt fine in the morning but as the day went on, my symptoms returned and I am finding it harder to hold my bladder. Also, for the first time, I tried going for a run. The entire time I felt a heaviness in my bladder and felt a strong urge to urinate, even though I went before my run began. What do you think could be going on? My doctor believes that it is either a UTI, or most likely, a hypersensitive bladder due to exam stress. However, there have been days where I have not felt stress at all yet symptoms have continued. I am really worried as I want to go back to work in five days and I do not think I will be able to manage the way things are at the moment. My family doctor does think this will settle down now that I have finished exams. Do you think there is a chance it could? I have mentioned this query to another doctor online, and he believed it may be due to an overactive bladder. However, since I am relatively young to receive this diagnosis, I wanted a second opinion, if that is alright. Do you think this could be OAB? I am worried that it could be something serious, like multiple sclerosis. One and a half years ago, I had an episode of sudden onset numbness in one arm and fearing the same thing, I ended up having an MRI of my brain and lumbar spine which both came back negative. Do you think this could be MS?",

Life is like a game, sometimes we lose some game and win some other. You are a great person, and you have the capacity to win the game. She is not the only one who left you. There are many others who are more worse than her. So don't worry and try to forget her. It is not easy to forget someone, but you have to try. There are many methods to forget someone, like meditation etc. Try them and move on in your life.",

My doctor arrived at the 4 mg per day amount gradually and it works very well along with CBT from a therapist. Before two months, when I received the medication from the pharmacy it was for 3 mg /day. I asked them to double check and that was the quantity that my doctor had written. I call his office and the office manager said that she would ask him about it. When I called the next day she said that he did not make a mistake and I asked for an explanation and was told that he did not give one.I started to feel sick a few days later and panic attacks actually started to increase the day that I talk to his office manager. I suffered minor but disruptive withdrawal symptoms physically and mentally for about two weeks and then they subsided but panic attacks continued to occur at random every day and my GAD symptoms increased to the point where CBT methods were not working.Then last month, the script was back to 4 mg per day normal dosage. I thought yes, back to normal. But again this month the script was back down to 3 mg per day which means I am going to experience a minor hell again.I am a defense and aerospace engineer who works on a contract basis through an agency and the client had noticed a drop in my performance before month but back to normal last month, now they are going to see it again and I will probably lose the contract job. I also started online system engineer classes and I am freaking out over being able to handle the exams and homework as I typically work on the class at night and am now without my evening dose.

Because this is not a emergency case. The cause of this symptom is, probably an infection of the tongue. The infection of the tongue can be caused by bacteria or virus. The bacteria or virus can be caused by not taking care of the tongue properly such as not brushing the teeth, not using mouth guard etc. The infection of the tongue can be caused by the lack of hygiene, not using mouth guard etc. The infection of the tongue can be caused by the lack of vitamin B-12, such as beef, pork, chicken. To solve this problem, you should go to the doctor to get the examination and the medical treatment. I will suggest to use the mouth guard to protect the tongue from the bacteria.

I took them for three to four days before my expected period date and had the tablet two to three times a day. Last dose I had it just the night before having sex. I had sex many times the next night but with protection and took an i-pill to be sure. Next week got light periods that were very painful. But ignored it thinking it was because of hormonal imbalance. Both of us were affected by flu and it turned into a stomach infection with alternate periods of diarrhea and constipation that was accompanied with mild nausea but had no vomiting. I became very weak and then eventually recovered by taking Pantocid, Digene and Zandu pancharishta. I am six days overdue and had slight back pain, nausea and increased urination. I do have migraine issues as well as I am quite obese with a BMI of 33.8. I got two home pregnancy tests done and both of them turned out to be negative. However, I still have not got my periods yet and I have been insisted to check for PCOS and get an ultrasound done. I am worried if the ultrasound shows that I am pregnant. I have gained about 4 kg. Is it possible to get a false negative six weeks after having sex? What can I do to get my periods early? Please advice.\n\n### Response:Hi, I had sex on 14th July 2018 and took Regestone on 16th July 2018. I became pregnant on 20th July 2018 and had slight bleeding on 24th July 2018. I am quite obese with BMI 33.8 and my due date is 28th July 2018. Can I get my periods early?",

Initially, she got eczema kind small red rashes for which we applied Corticosteroid and later we observed whitish patches developing on those spots. Initially, the GP thought it could be tinea versicolor and suspected it could also be vitiligo.He referred us to a skin specialist and initially, the skin specialist thought it could be hypopigmentation and after a month, in the next appointment, she thought it could be vitiligo and started with Tacrolimus and Corticosteroid cream.Even before we started applying this Tacrolimus, we saw some repigmentation in some areas but it was slow repigmentation. We were confused as is it vitiligo or not and also as we are applying strong creams for a 6-year-old girl. Any long-term issues?We want to have a second opinion. I live in a city where it is very difficult to get skin specialist appointments. They give for every three to six months. Could you please help us in diagnosing the skin patches and treatment?

The problem is that I have developed extreme sensitivity to most of the drugs, medication, treatment. In the past, there were many instances of adverse reactions by taking medicines of Iron composition. These include restlessness, breathing problem, and diarrhea. About five years ago, upon the doctor's advice and supervision, I was fed intravenously through saline bottle with some Iron injection to it. Immediately in about 15 minutes after the procedure, I experienced shortness of breath, burning sensation in muscles, swelling of legs, fatigue, and diarrhea. It subsided when I was given an antidote by the doctor immediately. From then onwards I was reluctant to take any of my medicines and undergo any treatment. I just focussed on improving my diet. Recently upon doctor's advice, I took some medical tests and the reports were serum ferritin: 3.0 ng/mL, vitamin B12: 129 pg/mL, TSH: 0.02 \\xb5IU/mL (but T3/T4 tests are fine), iron: 15 \\xb5g/dL, TIBC: 527 \\xb5g/dL, hemoglobin 7.7 g/dL, vitamin D: 18.39 ng/mL. I was also informed that I developed food allergy to some foods. Lately, I am experiencing a headache with activity, unexplained generalized weakness, fatigue most of the time. According to the doctor, I am in a very critical position and should be immediately treated with Iron injections, blood transfusion, etc. But, I am really worried as my body will not be able to take these treatments (as I faced adverse reactions in the past).

I can barely sit and watch videos, eat and use the toilet. I am not able to do any other work.

Clumsiness - when pressing buttons on the computer or microwave I often miss the button and while opening drawers or doors I grasp air instead of the handle, etc.Eye coordination problems - while reading my eyes jump over words thereby making me misread words for something else or just omit words.Cognitive difficulty - with mental arithmetics and planning and I often mispronounce words or use different words than the appropriate one in a sentence during speech.Post-void urinary dribbling and frequent defecation.Flashes of past memory like dreams while awake, euphoria turning into nausea and extreme tiredness afterwards.Pain in the neck, muscle cramps and stiffness in the neck and TMJ area.

It may be due to some vitamin deficiency or due to some other cause. Take multivitamin syrup for 7 days. Do blood test for hemoglobin and vitamin D levels.

I have been jumping from one idea to another for a long time but it has been three years I have an issue with frequent urination. It started in a bad time for me when I was obsessing that I have HIV. No burning, just slight urethra burning. I went to a urologist. He told me nothing was wrong, maybe an overactive bladder. I go to the toilet every two hours or three. I never knew what was wrong, but I started to obsess over it and it got worse to a place that my mind is in urination 24/7. I almost gave up until I went on a vacation and during that vacation, I forgot about it totally. The frequency was gone and even the burning urethra. Also, I had to remove my wisdom teeth and when I did, I was so occupied thinking about it that I forgot about urination and I noticed that I do not use the bathroom like I used to. But, I got back obsessing about it again and it got to a point that I urinate a lot of high volumes every hour. It comes suddenly and goes on its own. I use to get those episodes every few months when I had stress but since I got the fear it might never go away I get it almost daily now. I do not know what to do. Can anxiety cause polyuria like this clear urine when I am stressed?",

It is due to caffeine your mind is too much active due to anxiety. You should take some anxiolytic like clonazepam 0.5 mg twice a day and some antidepressant like mirtazapine 7.5 mg once a day. It will reduce your anxiety and frequent urination. Thanks",

However, they are most likely secondary to chronic small vessel disease. There is no evidence of restricted diffusion to suggest an acute infarct, midline shift or mass effect. There are no blood products on the gradient-echo images.Normal intracranial flow-voids are seen.The visualized paranasal sinuses are clear.There is no pathologic enhancement identified.Degenerative changes are noted within the upper cervical spine.Impression:1. No acute intracranial process.2. Mild cerebral atrophy and mild chronic small vessel disease.3. No pathologic enhancement identified.What should I do and how concerned should I be? I am 70 years old and my BP and cholesterol are controlled. How concerned should I be?\n\n### Response:You should be concerned if you develop symptoms of acute cerebral ischemia.

        "input": "Hi doctor,My mom is 83 years old. She had a bad fall 1.5 years ago and suffered with a head injury with little internal bleeding and a broken arm. While in hospital, she contracted C.diff and has had several recurring bouts with it. She has had a transplant and so far she is doing well with no recurrence. She also has a fistula near the rectum from an abscess. They put in a tube to keep it open and flowing. She has always had bouts of constipation and diarrhea for years before the accident. Her cognitive functions have been diminishing. One of my brothers is living with her and care taking her for full time.She is very weak, but can walk with the aid of a walker. Before the accident, she was fine. But, she may have shown a few signs of slight memory issues and balance prior to the accident as well. Our main issue right now is loose stools with some fecal incontinence. The doctor said that the fecal incontinence is because of a weak rectum that will not hold back fecal matter. Also, the fistula is always draining. When her stools are normal, she has good energy and cognitive function. When she has loose stools, she is very weak and can hardly stand or walk. Her cognitive function is a lot worse. She gets very confused about daily items and memory issues.We are looking for supplements to keep her regular and avoid the loose stool episodes. These are recurring every other week. Being so weak at the time of an episode, the toilet and the surrounding area get very filthy. She has little control and not able to clean herself properly. Her diet is pretty good. We are trying to keep dairy items away, limiting sugar and some carbohydrates as best as we can.We are giving her Metamucil when she has loose stools as well as some ammonium. This seems to have very limited success. She is on a blood pressure medicine as well as on Coumadin. So, we have to watch for interactions between everything. Regarding supplements, right now she is taking Alpha-GPC, Prevagen and multivitamins B for cognitive help, Fish oil, turmeric and Centrum multivitamins.Any help or suggestions to prevent the loose stools without creating constipation would be appreciated. I would also like to increase her core energy, so she will feel more like moving around. We have a physical therapist at once a week.",

Your mother is suffering from recurrent loose stools and weakness. It is due to decreased bowel movements. She is also suffering from Alzheimer's disease. It is important to watch her diet and give her adequate fluids. You should also give her adequate fiber supplements like multivitamins. She should take regular medicines like alpha GPC, Centrum and move. Physical therapy will also help her to improve her weakness. Please consult a physician for further management. Thanks",

So, I stopped taking the Clomid in March this year and had my physical last week.The doctor says my testosterone is 570, A1c is 6.0 and everything else looks good. He says since I still have symptoms, that I have testosterone resistance. His analogy was; like diabetics, their bodies produce insulin but just does not know what to do with it.So, his treatment recommendation is TRT testosterone replacement therapy along with Clomid. I am hesitant because I feel this therapy is overused nowadays, and I feel pretty good except my libido.Sought a second opinion today from my urologist, he seemed disinterested in me doing that but said if I try a few injections it would not hurt me, then advised me to run this by an endocrinologist.So I guess in summary:Do you believe that testosterone resistance is a valid diagnosis?If I do try the TRT, can I stop after a few weeks or a few injections and get back to the way I am right now with no permanent issues?Should I just start the Clomid again, or just keep using the Cialis and keep working out and trying to clean up my diet more?Any other thoughts and advise would be appreciated.

I went to my primary doctor three years ago with low libido and poor quality erections. Blood work came back as total testosterone 381 and A1c 6.9. Started exercising and lost weight and inches, 198 lbs to 178, 38-inch waist to 32. Symptoms still persisted.

Thanks.\n\n### Response:Hi, I went to my primary care physician because I was having problems with my libido and mild erection problems.  He did a complete physical and said I was in great shape otherwise.  Then he recommended I try the Clomid and see if that helps.  I started it, but after two weeks I had zero interest in sex.  I mean, I just felt like a zombie.  I had zero interest in having sex with my wife.  I felt like a robot. So I stopped the Clomid.  I guess I'll just stick with the Cialis and keep working out and eating healthy and see what happens.  What do you think?",

        "input": "Hi doctor,One year back, while sitting on a chair in office I felt as if my back got stuck and was unable to move. I took two painkillers and managed to sit there for a while, but after two to three hours the pain started radiating to leg. I was diagnosed with moderate disc herniation at L4-L5 and L5-S1. I was advised to take bed rest for three months and felt better after five months. Then I got some manipulation done with my lower back and my condition got worse. After that I had slight pain in my tail bone while walking and the pain got worse when I sit for five minutes. It got radiated to hips, thighs and it was worse when I stood up from a sitting position. Then I left with no option except bed rest for another four months that is a total nine months of bed rest. After that I suddenly started walking two to three hours a day in a stretch and started doing some exercises. After few days of getting my body too much into motion I felt my upper back getting stuck and again was unable to move and the pain radiated to my wrist and hand. Then had bed rest for another 10 days and felt a bit better. But, still in pain and resumed with two to three hours of brisk walking and exercises. I noticed that many joints in my body were making cracking sound while I walk or move my body and they were continuous. They are not going away no matter how much I move that joint, the cracking sound will repeat infinite times whenever I move my body. The cracking sound is mostly from lower and upper back, shoulder, ankle, foot fingers, knees also make that cracking sound and it is painful as well. Cracking sound in knees are felt more when I start walking after being in rest state and frequency of cracking sound reduces after walking for two to three minutes.I got my ESR and CRP checked. They are normal, but there is a slight increase in lymphocytes and RBC. Now, I have been suffering from this continuous cracking sounds and pain in almost all my joints for more than a month now. I also suffer from severe pain in tail bone area. Also suffers from some sensation loss (not persistent) in left side of my upper left leg, pain in groin area (but not anymore), pain in lower back and upper back. Also a few days back a physiotherapist did some manipulation, which again increased my problem and after that when I wake up in morning both my hands are badly at asleep. Doctors say that discs are hydrated and it is rather some other thing which is causing me problems but are unable to diagnose. The amount of rest I have taken and all those manipulations have gone through have only done badly rather than doing any good. I am only 27 years old and unable to do simple tasks like sitting for five minutes. Please help me, what could be the possible reason for all this.I had some back pain three years ago. My lifestyle is also not good. I do not used to any exercise or walk earlier, only sitting on a chair in front of a computer for 10-11 hours. I have also gained weight of 15 kg in 10 months.

I quickly pulled out and washed the genital area with a bathing soap. After few days, I started having a slight itching sensation in the penis. I visited a urologist and he asked me to undergo urine routine and culture tests. The urine culture report did not show any bacterial growth, but the urine routine showed some abnormalities. I have attached those two reports. On subsequent visit, the doctor prescribed me a 10 day antibiotic course (Microdox LBX 100 mg) to be taken twice a day. In addition to that, he also asked me to wash the penis with Betadine Povidone-iodine solution twice a day. The antibiotic course got over two days back. But since then, I have been noticing a slight burning sensation after passing urine, especially during morning and afternoon hours. Today, there is a slight pain in the penis.

        "input": "Hello doctor, For ten years, my husband has been successfully using an extended wear bandage contact lens (monthly wear) to control the pain of aphakic bullous keratopathy in one eye. About seven months ago, he had an episode of foreign body pain in the eye which the contact lens could not control. His optometrist changed the type of lens after remarking that the lens appeared tight. Although the painful sensations have decreased, they are still present with more of a sore feeling now. His ophthalmologist suggested that he discontinue the Azopt drops he had been using in case the preservative was causing some corneal toxicity. His eye pressure without the drops has read at 18 and 20 on separate occasions, but he does have corneal edema which may affect the measurement. He has had high pressure in that eye previously, but it was mostly lowered by Cyclodiode treatment some eight years ago. The consultant said he had left him on the Azopt drops just as a precaution. My query is that if the bandage lens has worked so well for pain management for 10 years is it possible that it can continue to work? And if the Azopt drops and their preservative had caused some toxic reaction seven months ago, could that still be causing him to feel the discomfort? His consultant suggested out that he could have the eye removed to control the pain, but as he has what he feels is some slight, useful vision in that eye, he does not want to take such a drastic and life-changing step. In fact, he wants to pursue the least invasive course of action to relieve the pain he is getting. I would appreciate any advice you could give as he is in quite a bit of pain.",

Her Hb % and sugar are within the normal range.Again, she tried to conceive since three months ago along with Aspirin and folic acid. She missed her period last month. Her beta hCG was 9.20 mIu/ mL.

She has been taking Aspirin 50, folic acid, and Vitamin B12 since 3 months, but no conception occurred.  She has been trying for 3 months, but no success.  She has been diagnosed with PID.  We did a transvaginal ultrasound, and it showed a healthy uterus and ovary, but there is no fetal heartbeat.  We did a natural pregnancy test, and it was negative.  We did a HSG test, and it was also negative.  She has no periods since the diagnosis.  She has not even had a period since the diagnosis.  We did a laparoscopy, and it was also negative.  She is not pregnant.  I am worried that she might have a tube problem or some other problem. What should we do now?  I am also worried that she might have some kind of problem with her thyroid.  What should we do now?  She has been taking Synthroid 50",
