I know there's a function in Windows for it, but I'd like something that is cross-platform.\nAnswer 1: Here's a link to the ActiveState Recipes site that says how you can read a single character in Windows, Linux and OSX :\nhttps://code.activestate.com/recipes/134892/\nAnswer 2: if you just want to hold the screen so you can see the result on the terminal just write `input()` at the end of the code and it will hold the screen\n\n### Response:You can also use the following code to read a single character in Windows, Linux and OSX :\n```bash\ncat = \"Hello World\"`\n```\n\nAnswer 2: You can also use the following code to read a single character in Windows, Linux and OSX :\n```bash\ncat = \"Hello World\"`\n```\n\nAnswer 3: You can also use the following code to read a single character in Windows, Linux and OSX :\n```bash\ncat = \"Hello World\"`\n```\n\nAnswer 4: You can also use the following code to read a single character in Windows, Linux and OSX :\n```bash\ncat = \"Hello World\"`\n```",

In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht D\u00fcrer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim.

This can ultimately lead to type 2 diabetes, a serious condition in which the body becomes less able to regulate blood sugar levels properly. Symptoms of insulin resistance include fatigue, headaches, and an inability to concentrate.\nInsulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas, which helps to regulate blood sugar levels by telling the body when to sleep. When insulin levels are low, the body becomes less sensitive to blood sugar changes. This can lead to a host of health problems, including type 2 diabetes.\nTo prevent insulin resistance, it is recommended that adults sleep for at least seven hours per night. Sleeping for only one night can help to reset blood sugar levels and improve heart health.\nWhile sleeping, the body produces less insulin, which can lead to type 2 diabetes.

In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.",
