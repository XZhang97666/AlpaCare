If I do not have sex for days, they become sensitive. I was treated with Ceftum 500 mg, the first time I had an infection.

It is advisable to get examined for the infection and get an appropriate antibiotic prescription from a doctor. As a precautionary measure, you should also practice safe sex until the infection is completely gone. Additionally, it is best to get your testes checked by a doctor regularly to monitor the progress of the infection.",

Cocaine is quickly absorbed into the bloodstream and can stay in the system for up to three days. It can take up to a week for cocaine to leave the system completely. Cocaine is also stored in the sperm and can remain in there for up to 10 days after use. It is best to consult with a doctor before trying to conceive.",

Depending on the severity of his myopia, the doctor may prescribe corrective glasses, contact lenses or eye drops.

It is important to get tested for HIV, as the only way to know if you have been infected is to get tested. It is also important to remember that HIV can only be contracted from bodily fluids, so it is unlikely that you would have contracted HIV from the broken condom incident. It is also important to remember that not all sex workers are honest about their status, so it is possible that the sex worker was not being truthful. It is also important to practice safe sex in the future and use condoms to protect yourself from any potential STIs.",

This can lead to organ damage, so it is important to seek treatment. The patient should consult with a hematologist, who can perform more tests to confirm the diagnosis and develop a treatment plan.

Additionally, the patient should be monitored for any potential organ damage, and may benefit from lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise.",

I have stopped using soap and also took Clonafit 0.25 mg and Betonix- 10 prescribed by a dermatologist but there is no improvement. Please help me out of this.\n\n### Response:It sounds like you may have a condition called cholinergic urticaria. This is an itchy rash that is caused by heat, sweating, and exercise. It is often worse in humid conditions. Treatment includes antihistamines, cool showers, and avoiding triggers. You may want to consider seeing a dermatologist for further evaluation and treatment.",

For the past 3 months, I have been experiencing this facial tightness which comes pretty often throughout the day with different intensity. The facial tension usually comes half an hour after I leave the bed. The tightness on my face happens to be on both sides of my face but usually more intense on the right. At times, I can feel it from my neck all the way up to my face. As of recent, I have been feeling this slight burning sensation on my chest to my shoulders as well. Prior to this facial tightness, I have been suffering from this burning feeling on the centre of my chest for about a month. It was my first time experiencing heartburn and I thought it was heart related. Went for X-rays and echo heart ultrasound. Everything came out fine. I have a healthy heart. What made the burning chest sensation go away temporarily is lying down, eating, exercising and drinking alcohol. And the weird part is the same thing helps me relieve my facial tightness temporarily is the same thing as that for the burning chest sensation; lying down, eating, exercising and drinking alcohol.Since having this facial tightness, I have paid numerous visits to different doctors, even the neuro-specialist and they all said it was anxiety. The doctors did facial senses test where they take a piece of fine cotton to touch different parts of my face. I had to close my eyes and tell them where the spot is. I have no troubles at all. I did blood test. It came out normal. They told me I do not need to do any scans and that it was merely anxiety and it will go off by itself. I convinced myself that I had anxiety because of the one month heartburn ordeal that I was suffering from. Even though the facial tightness was there, I tried my utmost best to ignore it. I do not think that I have any anxiety in me now as I try not to think of the weird tightness sensation. However, it has been 3 whole months and now I am getting alarmed and worried that it is still here and with newer sensations as I described above. In all honesty, I do feel that the intensity of the facial tension as compared to I first experienced it, is less. However, it is always there even as when I am typing this. I do not see any physical change on my body. Not sure if it is neuro damage. I am worried sick.Hope I can get some form of advice and diagnosis.",

In general terms, it was informed about TB in her abdomen. Accordingly, medicines were given to her as per the advise of a local MD doctor. Treatment continued for three months and due to some discontinuation of medicine it relapsed and again she was diagnosed with Thicken bowel loop as per USG. Again treatment continued.However, while undergoing treatment she lost sensation in her legs and complained of losing sensation in her legs and numbness in her feet and was unable to put on slippers in her feet with difficulty in moving. She also complained that while moving she felt as if she was moving on a bed of soft cotton.Subsequent treatment by neuro experts revealed that overdose of treatment of her TB in abdomen resulted in this condition and she was diagnosed for peripheral neuropathy and was advised for biopsy for proper diagnosis. Meanwhile, she fell and hurt herself which was later on diagnosed that her spine at L3 - L4 was compressed due to felling abruptly and accordingly she was advised to take bed rest for three months. Slowly, she recovered from this condition felt pain in her back and was facing another kind of problem as she could not sit for a longer time and preferred to lay down on the bed.Finding her bad condition subsequetly, we also took consultation from other neuro experts at a prestigious institution where she was prescribed Lupivitin one tablet and Sammy one tablet.When condition persisted thereafter she was given Primosa one tablet daily, Neurox one tablet daily, Maxglobin 50 mg one tablet and Defart 6 mg.But, whenever she was given medicine her condition further aggravated. After about six months of treatment by the neuro expert, she has now been referred to the department of immunology for their advice. Meanwhile, we also took advice from a rheumatologist who diagnosed a kind of arthritis and started treating accordingly. He also started the course of Defzacort (steroid) along with other medicines. The steroid was prescribed with a decreasing dose per week from 60 mg per day to 6 mg per day.However, after taking about two months of steroid course her condition deteriorated and had severe breathlessness. Her blood sugar level also shot up and ultimately she was hospitalized and the treatment of steroid withdrawn. After 15 days of treatment at the hospital she recovered to her previous condition.

It is difficult to say what the cause of her current symptoms is without more information, but it is likely that her neurological symptoms are related to the TB treatment she received. It is also possible that her arthritis and breathing difficulties are related to the TB treatment. It is important that she see a doctor who can properly assess her condition and provide the best treatment plan. In the meantime, it is best to avoid any medications that have not been prescribed by a doctor.",

He was with someone who now has heart palpitations, sweaty palms and feet, and lightheadedness sitting in the living room. We ran a battery of tests when it first happened including TSH, EKG, lung scans, blood panels, etc. and everything was normal. So we went down the path of anxiety. Four years later, the symptoms continued. As my son now has a terrible fear of doctors, we tried a home blood test to get a full thyroid panel. I have attached the results.The blood work came back normal. Low normal TSH, but low normal T4 and lower normal free T4 and free T3. There is nothing that shows an abnormality. However, his urine test showed moderately low iodine and slightly low selenium. I have read that abnormalities in these measures could cause thyroid problems. What am I wondering is if these two indicators are worth further exploration with an endocrinologist knowing that going to the doctor will cause my son a severe panic.Also, is it possible that low iodine could have been a temporary diet thing and it is masking the signs of hyperthyroidism in the blood work? He has all of the symptoms of someone with hyperthyroidism.

The low iodine and slightly low selenium levels in his urine test could be indicative of an underlying thyroid issue. It is possible that his low iodine levels are due to a temporary dietary change, but it is also possible that it could be the cause of his thyroid symptoms. It is best to have him evaluated by an endocrinologist, as thyroid issues can run in families. The endocrinologist will be able to give a more conclusive diagnosis and recommend the best course of treatment.",

The fever and itching are common symptoms of fungal infections. The prescription given by the pediatrician (clotrimazole) is appropriate for treating a fungal infection. It is likely that the infection is not completely gone yet since the severity has reduced but is not completely gone.

The best way to do this is with surgery, which is why the doctors have recommended an ORIF. The fracture should be strapped or casted after surgery, so I would recommend getting it taken care of as soon as possible.

The test will check for any allergies or underlying conditions that could be causing the hives. Cetirizine (Zyrtec) is a common antihistamine used to treat allergic reactions, including hives. You could also try a different antihistamine, such as fexofenadine (Allegra) or loratadine (Claritin), to see if it provides better relief. It is also important to identify and avoid any triggers that may be causing the hives.",

Whenever I consult the doctor, he gives me the same medication. Please help me.\n\n### Response:Based on the patient's description, it is likely that they are experiencing pain and inflammation in the corner of their left eye. The initial treatment with Sterdex was appropriate, but it is likely that the pain has become more persistent and requires further investigation. It is also possible that the patient's vision has worsened due to the inflammation. I recommend that the patient see an eye specialist as soon as possible for further evaluation and treatment. The specialist may prescribe additional medications or perform tests to determine the cause of the inflammation and develop an appropriate treatment plan. Additionally, the patient should have regular eye exams to monitor their vision and ensure that their eyes are healthy.",

A low dose of testosterone (100-200 mg every 10-14 days) is usually recommended for cosmetic purposes. The injections are usually made from synthetic testosterone, not an animal source. Testosterone can affect your personality, so it is important to be aware of any changes. Additionally, you should be aware that testosterone injections may need to be taken for life in order to maintain the desired results. If you decide to stop taking the injections, you may loose some of the gains you have made.",

Alcoholic mouthwashes have a higher ability to reduce bad breath due to its antiseptic properties, but they can also dry out the tissues in the mouth and should be used with caution. Non-alcoholic mouthwashes are gentler on the tissues and are a good option for those who cannot tolerate the alcohol content. In terms of which is better, it really depends on the individual and their needs. In your case, it might be best to recommend a non-alcoholic mouthwash for those who are complaining of bad breath from smoking, as alcoholic mouthwashes can be too harsh on the tissues. Additionally, tongue scraping and regular brushing should be recommended in order to reduce bad breath.",

I have had a lot of digestive problems for about two years. I have been diagnosed with candida and dysbiosis but my regular doctor does not seem to know what is wrong with me. I have been very stressed and have suffered anxiety since I was about 16. I was not on any medications and started taking Cymbalta a few months ago.After about three to four days, I started to notice a bit of burning in my feet. I have since stopped taking the Cymbalta about a month ago. My feet seemed fine. Then seven days ago, I have started getting really bad pain in my feet and burning and tickling and pins and needle feelings. I am not diabetic or alcoholic. I have no idea what has brought this on or whether it can be reversed. I am so stressed out. I have to be on my feet for my job for about four and a half hours every morning. Can this be tested to see if the nerve cells are either dead or just damaged and can it be reversed? This feels like it is going to ruin my life. Please help.\n\n### Response:It sounds like you may be experiencing a neuropathy, which is a type of nerve damage that can cause symptoms like burning, tingling, and pins and needles. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including diabetes, alcoholism, certain medications, and infections. It's possible that the neuropathy you are experiencing is a result of the Cymbalta, so it's a good idea to talk to your doctor about this possibility. Your doctor may recommend tests to determine the cause and develop a treatment plan. In the meantime, it might be helpful to reduce your stress levels and rest your feet as much as possible.",

The presence of HSV IGM with a range of 1.15 indicates that you may be experiencing an active herpes infection, which needs to be treated before you attempt to conceive. It is also important to ensure that the CMV and rubella antibodies are still present and at safe levels before trying to conceive.

It is possible that the initial liver biopsy did not capture the entirety of the inflammation, or that the inflammation is related to a different underlying condition. It is advisable to get a second opinion from a liver specialist, as well as undergo further testing such as an ultrasound and/or an MRI scan of the liver to get a better understanding of the cause.

The small bumps in your tongue and the pain below your ear could be caused by stress or an infection, and it is advisable to visit a doctor to get it checked. It is understandable to be worried and stressed, but there is no need to panic. Six months after the exposure, the chance of staying negative is very high.

Wearing contact lenses for such a long period of time without a break can cause an infection or an abrasion on the eye. You should stop wearing your contact lenses immediately and visit an eye doctor as soon as possible to get it checked. You should also follow up with your regular doctor to make sure there are no long-term effects from wearing contact lenses for such a long time.",

I move my pupil left to right and see a bright arc of light. I cannot make it stay there, it just flashes as I move my eye balls left to right.

Entropic phenomenon are visual phenomena that occur within the eye and are typically caused by the structure of the eye itself or by certain medical conditions. In your case, it is likely that the flashes of light are caused by a fold in the clear membrane that covers the back of the eye (the retina). This fold is called the ciliary body and it produces the fluid that fills the eye. When light hits this fold just right, it may cause a flash of light that you are able to see. This is not cause for concern and is quite common. However, if the flashes become more frequent or you experience any other symptoms such as floaters, blurred vision, or loss of vision, you should consult an eye doctor immediately.",

The high ESR, CPR, and ANA levels indicate inflammation in the body. To reduce the inflammation and manage the pain, it is recommended that your mother take non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen or naproxen.

Additionally, she may benefit from physical therapy, which can help strengthen the muscles, improve mobility, and reduce stiffness. If the pain is not managed with these treatments, then it may be necessary to consult a rheumatologist, who can prescribe more powerful medications.",

You can also use salicylic acid based products to help remove the excess skin cells that block the pores. You can use a product with hydroquinone to reduce the pigmentation. After your acne has cleared, you can use a product with retinol to prevent further breakouts. For sunscreen, you can use a physical sunscreen that contains zinc oxide or titanium dioxide. For moisturizer, it is best to choose a product that is oil-free and non-comedogenic.",

Please help me.\n\n### Response:It sounds like you may have injured your neck while reaching for your forehead. This could have caused a strain or tear to one of the nerves in the area, leading to the pain and limited mobility you are now experiencing. I recommend that you seek medical attention as soon as possible to ensure that the injury is properly assessed and treated. In the meantime, you can apply ice to the area and take over-the-counter pain medications to help reduce the inflammation and pain. Additionally, you should avoid any activities or movements that increase the pain.",

So my blood results came back with an HCG OF 248 and the doctor said I am right around 1-2 weeks.So, here is my question. I have been stressing out badly due to the fact I have been on Lorazepam 1 mg every night for anxiety and PD for the last 2 years as well as Percocet 10 mg as needed for back pain.

The best remedy is to keep the area clean and apply an antibiotic ointment, such as Polysporin. If there is any swelling or redness, you can apply a cold compress to reduce the inflammation. If the symptoms persist for more than a day or two, or if you are concerned, you should consult a doctor.",

We recommend that you consider getting a pregnancy test done again in a few weeks to be sure. Additionally, if you are sexually active it is important to use more reliable forms of contraception, such as the implant or IUD, to prevent unintended pregnancies.",

It is also important to consider the side effects of chemotherapy and how they are affecting your quality of life. Your doctor will be able to give you a better idea of how many cycles are necessary. \n\nIt is normal to lose your appetite and have difficulty swallowing and eating during chemotherapy.

The symptoms she is experiencing are common with stomach infections, including nausea, vomiting, and loose stools. The fever of 101.3 degrees is also consistent with a stomach infection.

Extraction of the impacted tooth is the best option in this case. It is generally not recommended to wait and see if the tooth will come down on its own as this can cause further complications. Having the tooth extracted will prevent any further damage to the surrounding teeth and jaw.",

It is also possible that it could be a contributing factor. It is difficult to say without more information, but it is worth discussing with your doctor. They may want to do further testing or adjust your medication. It is also possible that the Sertraline is not working as well as it could be, and your doctor may want to consider a different antidepressant. It is also worth noting that thyroid issues can take time to diagnose, so it may be worth getting a second opinion if you are concerned.",

My resting heart rate is actually in the 40\\s. However, I do sometimes get palpitations and every once in awhile get a run of 5 to 7 in a row.

He seems to think I do not need the Flecainide, and maybe not even the ablation. I do not agree with him on the ablation due to recent medical studies on WPW and how ablation is recommended even for asymptomatic patients, especially athletes.My question is regarding Flecainide. I have not had any palpitations since I began taking it a few days ago, but I want to make sure this drug is not putting me at risk for creating a dangerous rhythm. Reading case studies and medical journals, it seems there is some risk. I have not been known to go into AF, and besides palpitations, I am asymptomatic with WPW.

I do not have any structural or plumbing heart issues. I have been diagnosed with WPW accidentally, and I am waiting for an ablation in 17 days. I am mostly asymptomatic, and I never had any extremely rapid heart rates. My resting heart rate is actually in the 40\\s. However, I do sometimes get palpitations and every once in awhile get a run of 5 to 7 in a row. The EP I saw in the hospital prescribed me Flecainide 50 mg, twice daily. I saw another EP, who was a much older guy, as a second opinion. He seems to think I do not need the Flecainide, and maybe not even the ablation. I do not agree with him on the ablation due to recent medical studies on WPW and how ablation is recommended even for asymptomatic patients, especially athletes.My question is regarding Flecainide. I have not had any palpitations since I began taking it a few days ago, but I want to make sure this drug is not putting me at risk for creating a dangerous rhythm. Reading case studies and medical journals, it seems there is some risk. I have not been known to go into AF, and besides palpitations, I am asymptomatic with WPW. Do you think Flecainide at this dosage is safe and reasonable for the next two weeks, until my ablation?\n\n### Response:It is difficult to give a definitive answer without knowing more about your medical history and the results of any tests you may have had. Generally, Flecainide is considered safe for short-term use in patients with WPW, however it is important to weigh up the risks and benefits. The most common side effects of Flecainide are nausea, dizziness, headache and fatigue. It can also cause a slow heart rate, which can be dangerous. It is also important to be aware of the risk of proarrhythmia, which is an increased risk of developing an irregular heart rhythm. It is therefore important to be aware of any changes in your heart rate or rhythm and to seek medical advice if necessary. It is also important to be aware of the potential interaction between Flecainide and other medications that you may be taking. It is always best to discuss the risks and benefits of any medication with your doctor.",

They can also be used to treat depression, but it is important to note that they can take up to 6 weeks to start working and you may need to try several different medications and dosages to find the one that works best for you. It is also important to talk to your doctor about any side effects you may be experiencing, as these can often be managed.

I suggest that you visit your doctor to get a proper diagnosis and treatment. In the meantime, you can apply a warm, moist cloth to the affected area a few times a day to help reduce inflammation and relieve discomfort. You should also avoid using any new products on your skin and avoid wearing tight-fitting clothing that could irritate the area. Good luck!",

However, it is common for orthodontic and maxillofacial surgeries to involve breaking and realigning the jaw, and the goal is usually to improve the patient's bite and the aesthetics of their smile. It is possible that her face may change slightly, but it is likely that any changes will be minor and difficult to notice. It is also important to consider that any surgery carries risks, so she should weigh these carefully before making a decision.",

My other iron levels are at 39 which has increased considering those references. But, that was probably because I did not use the medicine correctly, I was only taking 5 mg a day.

It is usually not a sign of any serious heart blockage, but it can be a sign of an underlying heart condition, so it is best to consult a doctor for further evaluation. \n\nThe test results indicate that the patient has very high levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL cholesterol, which are risk factors for heart disease. The patient also has low levels of HDL cholesterol, which is protective against heart disease. The high levels of lipoprotein a and non-HDL cholesterol are even more concerning, as these are strong predictors of heart disease. The patient also has high levels of sugar and HS-CRP, which are risk factors for heart disease. The patient's blood pressure is also slightly high.

The wisdom tooth oozes green pus if you apply pressure with a cotton swab. The decayed tooth is mildly painful. I saw my dentist a few days ago, who did not seem overly concerned. She slightly cleaned the gums around the wisdom tooth and prescribed me Cephalexin and sent me on my way. I have been taking Cephalexin for a few days, and yet the tooth is still oozing. My throat is red and irritated, the gums inflamed and there is no swelling in the mouth. Also, my nostril on that side is tender and painful. I am severely worried about the infection spreading to either my heart or my brain. In fact, I read an article a few days ago about a 26 year old who died from a tooth infection spreading.I do not have a fever. I have mild nausea. It is tender on that side of my jaw.

The first step would be to get the infections under control with antibiotics, and then have the teeth extracted by an oral surgeon. \n\nIn the meantime, I would recommend that you take the Clindamycin as prescribed by your dentist.

If you do experience any side effects, be sure to talk to your doctor right away. \n\nYou may also want to ask your doctor about taking probiotics while you are on the Clindamycin, as this can help reduce the risk of gastrointestinal side effects. Additionally, you could ask your doctor about taking an antiemetic (anti-nausea) medication to help with any nausea you may experience. \n\nI understand your fear of the potential side effects of the medications, but it is important to remember that the infections in your mouth could be much more dangerous if left untreated.

I am not getting any sleep lately because I listen to him all night. Is it dangerous to let him go on trying to sleep and have so much trouble breathing each night with possible sleep apnea? Please help. I am very concerned.\n\n### Response:It sounds like your son is having a difficult time sleeping due to enlarged tonsils and adenoids, which can lead to obstructive sleep apnea. It is concerning that he is gasping for air and having nightmares, as this can be very stressful for both the child and parents. It is also concerning that he is not growing as expected due to the Flonaise. It is best to discuss the options with your son's doctor, as they will be able to provide the best advice depending on the severity of the condition. It is possible that your son may need surgery to remove his tonsils and adenoids, or other treatments such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy. It is best to discuss all the options with your son's doctor to determine the best course of action. In the meantime, it is important to make sure your son is in a safe sleep environment and to provide comfort measures such as a warm bath, quiet activities, and comforting words before bed.",

It is important to finish the entire course of antibiotics, even if the fever comes down, to ensure that the infection is completely treated. It is also possible that your daughter may need additional medications, such as pain relievers or anti-inflammatories, to help her feel more comfortable. You should continue to give her the Meftal syrup as needed to bring down her fever, and you can also give her Calpol or SOS Meftal syrup for pain and fever relief. Make sure she is drinking plenty of fluids and getting adequate rest. If her fever does not go away or comes back often, you should take her back to the doctor for further evaluation.",

It is difficult to predict an exact adult height at this age, as children often experience a growth spurt around the time of puberty which can significantly affect their final adult height. It is best to consult with a pediatrician to get a better idea of what to expect.\n\nIt is possible that giving your children a protein powder could help them gain more muscle mass and increase their height, however it is best to consult with a doctor before giving them any supplements.

I went to a gastroenterologist, who did a colonoscopy and found that I had an anal fissure and internal hemorrhoid. He prescribed Sitcom Forte, Eldicet, Velgut, and Pankreoflat. He also gave me Sucralcoat Ano cream. However, every night I was in too much pain. So, early this year, I decided to consult an Ayurveda doctor who gave me some Kashayams and tablets. However, my pain did not subside. I used to evacuate the stools using my fingers. That eliminated the stools, but there was so much mucus released and extreme pain after motion. Two months ago, I went to a GP who gave me some antibiotics and painkillers for five days. During this time, I was always sleepy. I took leave from work and was always tired and fatigued.

The blocked nose and headaches are common symptoms of sinusitis. To relieve the symptoms, you should try to reduce the inflammation by getting plenty of rest, drinking warm fluids, and using a humidifier. You can also use over-the-counter pain relievers and decongestants to help reduce the symptoms. If the symptoms do not improve or get worse, you should consult a doctor.",

The period of time between the missed pill at 8 AM this morning and the time that she will take the morning-after pill (around 4 PM)?Do you recommend taking today's pill today if she is also taking the morning after pill today?Is there anything else we can do now to minimize the risk?Should we be worried?Thank you.",

Generally, if a woman has unprotected sex during the ovulation phase, there is a chance of pregnancy. The morning after pill can reduce the risk of pregnancy, but it is not 100% effective.

It is caused by increased sensitivity of the nasal membranes to various triggers, such as allergens, temperature and humidity changes, and even stress. The dizziness you are experiencing is likely due to the congestion and pressure in your ears.

You should also make sure to stay hydrated and practice good hygiene to reduce the dust in your environment. If these measures don't help, then you should consult a doctor in person who can prescribe more specialized treatments."

Resting and applying ice to the area may help reduce the inflammation and pain. You should also take pain and anti-inflammatory medications as prescribed by your doctor. If the symptoms do not improve or get worse, you should seek medical attention.",

The best way to avoid this is to follow your doctor's instructions on how to clean the area and to be careful with what you eat. The small patch of irritated gum on your second molar could be a canker sore, which is usually caused by stress or an irritation of the mouth. To help reduce the discomfort, you can use a topical anesthetic, such as viscous lidocaine, and practice good oral hygiene by brushing and flossing gently. You should also make sure to drink plenty of fluids and get plenty of rest.",

Dry socket usually occurs when a blood clot has not formed in the extraction site or has been dislodged. Symptoms of dry socket include pain, which can range from mild to severe, and an unpleasant odor or taste.

Initially, as suggested by the hospital pediatrician, they were given Dexolac Special Care, but after 20th day when their weight was around 2.4 Kg, they were given to Dexolac Premium 1. Out of the 2 babies, the weaker baby is responding well and quickly gaining weight (taking around 75 ml milk every 3 hours). But the baby which was born stronger is not drinking sufficient milk (45 ml in one feed, at an interval of around 3 hours), and is taking around an hour to take one feed. Also, she is having issues of gas and constipation. Because of constipation, she keeps crying. Now, this baby is not gaining weight and seem to be weaker. Please suggest what we can do in this case and shall we switch her milk to Lactogen or some other company?\n\n### Response:It is normal for one baby to drink more than the other. It is also common for one baby to gain weight more quickly than the other. It is possible that the baby who is drinking less and gaining weight more slowly may have an underlying medical condition. It is best to consult a pediatrician to rule out any potential issues. It may be beneficial to switch the baby to a different formula, such as Lactogen, to see if that helps.",

However, it is best to consult with a urologist to determine the best course of action. The urologist may recommend a repeat cystocele repair surgery to try to reposition the bladder. If the bladder is not repositioned, there is an increased risk of developing urinary tract infections and other complications.",

Last week after almost two years of not having a UTI I felt the horrible symptoms again. When going to the doctors UTI urine test came back positive. The doctor prescribed me seven days Nitrofurantoin antibiotics which cleared the pain and seemed gone entirely. Unfortunately two days later, the symptoms came back (please note that I had sex with my partner the day before) with burning sensation when urinating and painful when standing with the need to go toilet every 2 to 3 minutes. I went back to the clinic the same day to get it checked and take more antibiotics.But to my surprise, the urine test came back clear for UTI, and my symptoms disappeared. Then the doctor advised me to get tested for Chlamydia as the symptoms can sometimes be mistaken to be UTI.

Cerebral palsy is a group of disorders that affect a person's ability to move and maintain balance and posture. It is caused by damage to the developing brain that can occur during pregnancy, birth, or infancy. The most common symptoms of cerebral palsy are difficulty with muscle coordination, stiff or tight muscles, and exaggerated reflexes. It is also common for people with cerebral palsy to have difficulty with communication, cognition, and sensory processing.\n\nIt is great that your daughter is receiving help with her fluid and that her speech is beginning to return. It is also encouraging that she is making progress with her nonverbal communication and playing with toys. It is important to keep an open mind about her diagnosis and to continue to seek help and support for her development. An evaluation by a specialist should be able to provide more insight into her condition and the best way to support her.",

This condition can be caused by an infection or by an injury to the testicle, such as a blow or a twist. The ultrasounds you have had may have ruled out torsion, but it is still possible that this is the cause of your pain. It is also possible that the pain is due to a different type of infection, such as a sexually transmitted infection.

The pulling sensation and the firmness of your vagina could be due to changes in the natural balance of bacteria and fluids. It is possible that you may have developed a mild infection, which could be treated with antibiotics. It is also possible that the symptoms will resolve on their own with time.

The test results do not necessarily indicate that you will have an anaphylactic reaction to these foods, but it is best to avoid them for now and see an allergist for further testing and advice. Angioedema can be a symptom of anaphylaxis, so it is important to take this symptom seriously and seek medical attention if it occurs. An elimination diet can be helpful in identifying potential food allergies, but it is difficult to eliminate all potential allergens and it may not be possible to pinpoint the exact cause of the allergic reaction. It is best to work with an allergist to determine the cause of your allergic reaction and create a plan to manage your symptoms.",

The medications can affect hormones that regulate your menstrual cycle, leading to irregular periods. Additionally, the sudden weight gain could be due to the medications as well. It is best to talk to your doctor about your concerns and see if they can provide any alternatives to your current medications.",

It lasts a second or two but may repeat several times before stopping in five minutes or so. I went out in the garden today to dig a bit and wearing my HR monitor (I have got health anxiety, anxiety disorder as well as depression).

I tried a statin but the muscle pain was too great. In my EKG I have RBBB or LAFB which 14 years back after a stress test I was told that I was probably born with it. I had gone to see the cardiologist then because of getting skipped beats and GERD he told me to ignore them.

This can be caused by physical strain, viral infections, or gastroesophageal reflux disease. The elevated heart rate could be due to anxiety, and it is likely that the pain is exacerbated by physical exertion. It is advisable to rest and avoid any strenuous activity. You should also apply warm compresses to the area and take over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or paracetamol. If the pain persists for more than a few days or is particularly severe, you should consult a doctor. Additionally, it is important to monitor your heart rate and blood pressure, as costochondritis can lead to cardiac complications in some cases.",

Currently, I am taking tablet Fluvoxin 100 mg in the afternoon for OCD and depression, tablet Oxetol 450 mg in the evening for gelastic seizure, tablet Quetiapine 100 mg at night for delusions.\n\n### Response:It sounds like you may have a sleep disorder, such as dyssomnia. It is possible that the medications you are taking are contributing to your sleep issue. I suggest you speak to your doctor about adjusting the times that you take your medications, as well as possible alternatives. Additionally, it may be beneficial to speak to a sleep specialist who can help you determine the best course of action to get your sleep back on track. Good luck!",

The openings that are draining watery liquid are likely to be pustules, which are also a sign of a bacterial infection. It is possible that the infection has spread from your throat to your mustache area. The best course of action would be to visit a doctor and get it checked. The doctor may prescribe antibiotics to treat the infection.",

It is also possible that the virus could have been transmitted through unprotected anal sex, even if a condom was used some of the time. It is also possible that the parasitic infection could have weakened your immune system and made it easier for you to contract HIV.

The intermittent twitching in a single muscle for several weeks without any other symptoms or changes in strength or reflexes suggests that it is more likely a benign fasciculation. It is possible that the twitching is related to an underlying cause such as an injury or a neurological condition, so it is advisable to get it checked by a neurologist for peace of mind. The doctor may recommend further tests such as an MRI or EMG to rule out any potential causes.",

It is possible that the peeling lips are related to stress, so it might help to try some stress reduction techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, or yoga.

From the reports, it appears that your mother has been diagnosed with ER+/PR+, HER2- breast cancer. The recommended treatment of eight cycles of chemotherapy followed by 17 injections of hormone blocking therapy is in line with the standard of care for her condition. However, the treatment plan is quite intensive and may not be suitable for your mother. \n\nAn alternative treatment option could be targeted therapy, which is a type of drug treatment that uses drugs to target specific characteristics of cancer cells. This type of therapy may be used in combination with chemotherapy or hormone therapy, or on its own. It is important to discuss the risks and benefits of each treatment option with your mother's oncologist to make an informed decision.",

They also gave me the Holter monitor and when they checked the results they said this was normal. I do not smoke or drink alcohol maybe three times a year I will drink. I used to do some shisha but that has stopped for the past three years.Since then I have never been to a hospital for the health of my heart. However, since then, my heartbeat has just been higher than everyone else but I do not get headaches or any other symptoms. I used to stress a lot. However, things are going well now and it has cut down. I wake up at times during the night but fall back asleep very easily. I have done gym and dance classes for over a year and I feel fine when working out.I went to the GP just a week ago due to my girlfriend having some concerns. I asked them to do a regular check and they said my heartbeat at that moment was 98 and he said this was fine. However, my girlfriend gets really worried about this and feels that something will happen to me. She just needs some medical advice in order to get her the assurance. She has been checking online for some answers and it is said stuff like arrhythmia, tachycardia, etc. She also says that the normal is between 80-100 bpm and why is mine on the top end? Is it a serious cause? Or does heart and pulse rate vary? Also, I have been checking the prevalence of heart diseases, etc., online and it is very rare for someone at my age. What more should be done?\n\n### Response:Based on the patient's description, it is likely that the patient is experiencing tachycardia, which is a condition characterized by a resting heart rate of 100 beats per minute or more. Tachycardia can be caused by physical exertion, anxiety, fever, or other medical conditions. It is important for the patient to get further checked by a doctor to rule out any potential underlying medical conditions. The doctor may recommend further tests such as an electrocardiogram (ECG) or an echocardiogram to get a better understanding of the patient's heart health. Additionally, lifestyle changes such as reducing stress, exercising more, and quitting smoking and alcohol consumption may be recommended.",

It is possible that your anxiety and difficulty penetrating your partner's vagina were related to your first experience with sex, and this may be something that you can work through with your partner.

UTIs are caused by bacteria, and can produce symptoms such as a strong odor, cloudy urine, and burning during urination. You should visit your doctor to get an accurate diagnosis and treatment. They may prescribe antibiotics to clear up the infection. In addition, drinking plenty of water and cranberry juice can help flush out your system and reduce the symptoms.",

The presence of a rudimentary horn is usually not a cause for concern, as long as the uterine cavity is normal. The fact that you have been ovulating normally and have a good endometrial lining increases your chances of getting pregnant. It is also encouraging that four follicles ruptured on the same side, as this could indicate that the eggs were able to reach the fallopian tubes. It is too soon to lose hope, and I would advise you to wait for the results of your IUI cycle before making any conclusions. Good luck!",

The stinging pain could be due to an infection or swelling of the prostate, or it could be related to a varicocele, which is an enlargement of the veins draining the testicle and scrotum.

It would be great to get in touch with a specialist.I am currently on Euthrox 100 mcg, Cabergoline 0.25 mg once a week, and Folic acid 450 mg daily.\n\n### Response:It is great to hear that your prolactin levels have returned to normal. With your thyroid condition being well-controlled, you and your husband should be able to prepare for pregnancy. It is important to ensure that your thyroid hormone levels are within the normal range before you conceive. You should also discuss with your endocrinologist the need to monitor your thyroid hormone levels more frequently during pregnancy. Additionally, you should take a multivitamin containing folic acid in the recommended dose of 400-800 micrograms daily. It is also important to ensure that your pituitary gland is functioning normally. Your endocrinologist may recommend tests such as an MRI scan to check for any changes in the pituitary gland. Once you and your husband are ready to conceive, you should consult a fertility specialist who can help you with the best options for conception.",

This can be caused by the mother's diet, such as consuming dairy products, soy, or other foods that contain high levels of protein. This can lead to symptoms such as frequent stools, rash around the anus, and fussiness. To help alleviate the symptoms, I recommend that you eliminate all dairy and soy products from your diet and speak to your doctor about possible medications or an alternative formula. The noises from your baby may be caused by gas, which is common in babies. You can help reduce this by burping your baby more often and trying to keep him in an upright position after feedings.",

It is white color although, the one on the top started to have a slight pink color. But the second one on the bottom which is much smaller still has completely white color and around the vagina blades, I have a little while dots. Also, there are very tiny warts line along the blades. So, when I went to see the GP near my house he had a look and said that there is nothing to worry it is still small. But in my opinion, I think it is quite big. So the doctor gave me a prescription for Condyline paint which he told me to use for three days only per week and I have to keep using it for three weeks and if it does not get better he told me to see him again. Now I have a few questions. Is this mean I have an HPV virus inside my body? How can I make the virus go away permanently? Will Gardasil injection make it go away? If it does not go away permanently, how can I make sure that I have no HPV viruses and so these warts will not come back again? Is this mean that I have this HPV from my boyfriend? How to use Condyline paint correctly? I wash my vagina blades and use the cotton pads to dry it, then I use start to use the Condyline paint. I only dip the swab once into the reagent and then I open my vagina blades so that I am able to paint the two warts inside my vagina as much as I can. Then I paint it all over the very tiny warts in the vagina blades area. Am I doing it correctly?Now I have been using the Condyline for two days, but the very tiny warts that are around the vagina blades started to grow more. Is this mean anything? Can condoms prevent these HPV viruses? If I break up with my boyfriend, will this help my symptoms and health to become better? I am very scared of whether this can leads to cancer? I do not want this to ever happen to me again, how can I prevent this to happen again?If my warts are gone can I have sex with my boyfriend? Will these symptoms comeback again? If I decided to buy the Gardasil injection and injected it now, then the next after two months, then next after six months, but during this time can I have sex with my boy friend? Will the vaccine still work?",

The Gardasil injection can help protect against certain strains of HPV, so it may be a good option for you. It is important to use the Condyline paint as prescribed by your doctor, and to make sure that the warts are completely covered. You should also use a cotton swab to apply the paint, rather than a Q-tip. It is possible that the very tiny warts are a reaction to the Condyline paint, so it is important to continue using it as prescribed. Condoms can help protect against HPV, but they are not 100% effective. It is best to break up with your current partner to avoid any potential risk of transmitting the virus. If you do have sex with your partner again, make sure to use condoms to protect against HPV. If the warts are gone, you should wait until they are completely gone before having sex with your partner. The symptoms should not come back if you take the necessary precautions. It is best to discuss your options with your doctor before making any decisions.",

I am told that beta-blockers even though anti-arrhythmic can also be pro arithmetic as well should I take this every day or should I only take this when I start to feel palpitations.\n\n### Response:It sounds like you may be experiencing a form of arrhythmia, which can cause the symptoms you describe. Propranolol is a beta blocker, which is often used to treat arrhythmias, and it sounds like it is helping you. It is best to take it as prescribed by your doctor, but you should also be aware of any side effects and discuss these with your doctor if they become a problem. It is also important to have regular check-ups to monitor your heart health.",

I had two debridement surgeries and was discharged after 5 days. I was treated with about 4 IV antibiotics. I do not remember them all, I recall seeing Vancomycin and Penicillin. I was told that the infection was not MRSA, but a \"slower moving bacteria\" they did not tell me what it was. I was swabbed for MRSA in my nose and butt before both surgeries and was told I did not have it. For the last day of my stay, I had a roommate who had a bad MRSA infection on her butt and sometimes had diarrhea incontinence during dressing changes. I had no physical contact with her, but we had the same nurse. I was discharged with a five day course of Augmentin.The wound has been healing very well and has not gotten infected, but three weeks after discharge I got an abscess under my arm. I went to an urgent care and was prescribed Clindamycin and told to return in three days for drainage. The abscess did not improve or get worse over the three days. I got it drained and was prescribed Augmentin and told to also continue the clindamycin. That was a week ago and the wound is healing well. They called today and said cultures show it was MRSA and they prescribed Bactrim and told me to stop the other antibiotics.I am feeling devastated by this and wanting to understand why it happened. Could I have gotten it in the hospital? I am concerned that it will not go away. Are those swabs at the hospital conclusive and mean for sure I did not have MRSA a month ago?

It is also possible that you were colonized with MRSA and it did not show up in the swabs. It is also possible that you developed MRSA while in the hospital, although it is unlikely that it was from your roommate since she had diarrhea incontinence during dressing changes. It is more likely that you were exposed to MRSA in another way. \n\nIt is possible that the MRSA infection under your arm was caused by a break in your skin from the Augmentin, which can cause a reaction in some people. It is also possible that the MRSA was present on your skin and the Augmentin provided the right environment for it to grow. \n\nIt is important to finish the Bactrim and Augmentin as prescribed. You should also continue to practice good skin care, including washing your hands often, keeping your skin clean and dry, and using an antibiotic ointment on any breaks in the skin. You should also avoid contact with other people who have MRSA until the infection is gone. \n\nIt is also important to take care of your mental health during this time. MRSA can be difficult to treat and it can be stressful and scary. Consider talking to a therapist or mental health professional if you need additional",

The doctors were looking for a potential lymphoma, but nothing conclusive was found. I am worried about the future cancer risk. Please help.\n\n### Response:From the information you have provided, it sounds like the CT scans were performed within a month of each other and were for the chest, abdomen and pelvis. The scans were looking for a potential lymphoma, but nothing conclusive was found. Based on the information you have provided, the radiation exposure from the CT scans is likely within the range of what is considered safe. The risk of developing cancer from the radiation exposure is very small, and is far outweighed by the benefit of ruling out a potential lymphoma. If you are still concerned, you could discuss your risk with your doctor or a radiologist who performed the scans.",

By the way, I did my acne scar regions with 2.00 mm needles.\n\n### Response:It is generally not recommended to drink more than two glasses of wine per day, and definitely not a whole bottle, as it can lead to dehydration and slow down the healing process. Similarly, drinking a few bottles of beer can also lead to dehydration and delay the healing time. As your micro needling session involved 2.00 mm needles, the healing time should be around 6 weeks. However, if you have been drinking alcohol excessively, it may prolong the healing time. It is best to avoid alcohol during the healing process.",

She tapered off the Lamotrigine, which was very difficult.It has been three to four weeks since her last dose of Lamotrigine, and nine weeks since her infusions. She is feeling very moody and depressed, irritability, fatigue, loss of focus. The question is, do you think she needs to go back on the Lamotrigine? Or does she need to get a booster shot of Ketamine? Both are difficult solutions. Getting off the Lamotrigine was awful, and getting Ketamine requires out of town travel, etc. Kindly advice.\n\n### Response:It is difficult to say without having examined your wife, but it is possible that she may benefit from going back on Lamotrigine. It is also possible that a different medication or a different dosage of Lamotrigine may be beneficial. It is also possible that she may benefit from psychotherapy. It is best to consult with a psychiatrist to determine the best course of action.",

This may include psychotherapy and/or medication. It is also important to make sure that his symptoms are not related to something else, such as an infection or another medical condition. Therefore, it is recommended that he have a full medical evaluation, including laboratory tests, to rule out any other potential causes.",

It has been almost three weeks since I stopped Lyrica, Pregabalin completely for back pain. For the last week I have been experiencing something different which can be best described as random pressure or light pain almost behind both the ear lobes, sometimes the feeling is localized just there other times it travels towards the neck, occasionally towards the mastoid bone or it extends towards the lower jawline. I have been crazily searching to see if this is a result of any swollen lymph node fearing cancer but I could not find anything out of the ordinary on the body.

This nerve is responsible for sensation in the face, and when it is compressed or irritated it can cause sharp, electric-like pain in the areas it supplies. The pain can be intermittent and can spread to other areas of the face and head. It is possible that the sinus infection you experienced could have caused the compression of the trigeminal nerve, leading to the pain you are currently experiencing. Treatment for trigeminal neuralgia includes medications such as carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and gabapentin, as well as surgical options. It is best to consult a doctor to determine the best course of treatment.",

This is an overuse injury that is caused by repetitive strain to the patellar tendon, which attaches the patella (kneecap) to the tibia (shinbone). Symptoms include pain around and behind the kneecap, which is usually worse with activities like squats. Treatment includes rest, ice, physical therapy, and sometimes anti-inflammatories or corticosteroid injections. I would recommend resting from squats for now, and trying other lower body exercises like leg presses and lunges. You may also want to try using an elastic band around the knee for stretching and strengthening exercises.",

Clop-G cream may be helping to reduce the symptoms, but it is important to get to the root of the problem. I recommend that you visit your doctor who can prescribe a more suitable treatment.

Melanoma usually presents as a new mole or a change in an existing mole. It is usually asymmetric in shape, has an irregular border, is variable in color, and is larger than 6 mm in diameter.

Did my tooth die? What are they checking for when they x-ray the tooth?\n\n### Response:When you were 11 years old, it is likely that the trauma caused your tooth to become pulpally inflamed or infected. This can sometimes cause the tooth to become discolored. Your dentist was likely checking for signs of inflammation or infection with the x-rays. The good news is that it appears the tooth has healed well and is currently healthy. It is possible that the tooth may be more susceptible to further injury or decay in the future, so it is important to continue good oral hygiene habits and have regular dental checkups.",

It is possible that the wires from your braces are rubbing against your ear, which could be causing the ringing. You could try adjusting the wires to see if that helps. If that does not work, you may want to consider seeing an ear, nose, and throat specialist to rule out any other potential causes.

I recommend that you make an appointment with your doctor as soon as possible in order to get it checked out. They will be able to give you a more accurate diagnosis and recommend a suitable treatment, if necessary. In the meantime, it is best to avoid scratching the mole, as this can irritate the skin and make any symptoms worse.",

My eye health is otherwise perfect (had them checked out a week before this came on). After a few days, it spread to the other eye. I expect the first eye will heal first, even though the second eye is not as bad. One question is when the first eye heals, do I need to protect it from re-infection from the one that is still healing?Also, on the typical length of healing, I am not quite at two weeks yet (this is day 11 for the first eye), but the lack of improvement in my condition is becoming frustrating to me. Today the vision in the first eye is smudgy, and the vision in the second eye is better, but not perfect.

How many weeks are weeks generally? I was told I have a mild to moderate case, but all I know is that I have seen no real progress, and I think the virus might have even spread to one of my sinuses.

It is also possible that the virus has spread to your sinuses, as conjunctivitis and rhinitis often occur together. It is best to protect the first eye from reinfection until it has fully healed, which could take up to three weeks. You could also try using a warm compress to help speed up the healing process. As for your mental health, it is normal to feel frustrated and impatient, but it is important to be patient and give your eyes time to heal. You could also talk to your doctor about any anxieties or concerns you may have.",

Masturbating excessively can cause irritation and small abrasions on the skin, which can lead to blisters. It is normal to be concerned, but it is important to remember that masturbation is a completely natural and healthy activity. To help reduce discomfort, you can apply an over-the-counter topical cream or ointment, such as hydrocortisone. If the blisters do not clear up within a few weeks, or if they become painful or irritated, you should consult a doctor.",

Night: Clozapex 25 mg half a pill, Mirtimash 30 g half a pill, Depakine Chrono 500 mg one pill, and Anafranil 75 mg half a pill.I used to take more but I stopped them over the past two years. For example, I used to take double the mentioned dose about nine months ago. I recovered from depression a couple of months ago. I started detoxing but with my doctor, the process was going way too slow and I have gained 45 kilograms over the past two years (25 in the past two months alone!) my muscles, my bones, and my joints started to hurt really bad because of my weight. Nothing works. I go to the gym every day, I workout but still I eat way too much because of the drugs and I cannot control it. My doctor does not want me to stop despite every hardship that I face and even refuses to decrease half a pill from the prescription. However, three weeks ago, I decided to cut all medications once and for all. I lost 7 kilograms, I stopped eating too much and just by cutting down the drugs I saved not less than 1800 calories per day. I started going to the gym more regularly. But here is the problem.Clozapex 25 and Mirtimash make me sleep and without them, I cannot sleep. No kidding, I have not slept in the past three weeks more than a maximum of 70 hours.

It is understandable that you want to stop taking the medications, but it is important to do so under the supervision of a doctor. Suddenly stopping medications can lead to unpleasant side effects, so it is best to work with a medical professional to taper off the drugs in a safe and controlled manner. In the meantime, there are some things you can do to try to improve your sleep. Avoid caffeine and alcohol, and create a consistent sleep schedule by going to bed and waking up at the same time each day. Exercise regularly, but avoid doing so too close to bedtime. Make sure your bedroom is dark, cool, and quiet, and try to clear your mind before sleep by practicing relaxation techniques like deep breathing or listening to calming music.

I woke up and never got any advice off the urologist because I never saw him after the procedure. The nurse who discharged me told me to take off the dressing in the morning and wash the wound and the foreskin twice daily. My concern is today I noticed my foreskin has become swollen and looks similar to a balloon. The stitches are preventing me from pulling my foreskin back over the glans. So, it has been retracted all this time. Is the swelling normal and due to the incision or is it not normal? Also, am I suppose to keep it pulled back or do I try to push it back over the glans? My glans is very sensitive. So, it feels like an electric shock every time I move.",

You should keep the foreskin pulled back, as it needs to be kept clean. It is normal for the glans to be sensitive, and you should try to push the foreskin back over it gradually. You should also apply an antibiotic ointment to the area to help reduce inflammation and promote healing. If the swelling and sensitivity does not improve within a few days, you should contact your doctor for further advice.",

It is possible that the tooth at the back is a supernumerary tooth, which is a tooth that erupts beyond the normal number of teeth. It is also possible that the tooth is an impacted tooth, which has not broken through the gums. It is best to consult a dentist to determine the cause of the extra tooth and to get advice on the best treatment option. Depending on the cause, your dentist may recommend extraction of the extra tooth, or orthodontic treatment to move the other teeth into place.",

This is a common side effect of using topical medications such as Dapsone, BP 205, and Adapalene. The red part encircled may be PIH as well. It is possible that using Adapalene 0.1% with Clindamycin 1% could improve skin texture, but it is best to speak to a dermatologist regarding your options.

Please give me a detailed answer and also give me advice for the treatment.\n\n### Response:It is likely that the molluscum contagiosum and skin tag were caused by a virus, such as human papilloma virus (HPV). HPV is a very common virus and can be spread through skin-to-skin contact, including during sexual activity. It is possible that you were exposed to HPV through a sexual partner, even if you were using a condom. The genital warts are also likely caused by HPV, and it is possible that you have a different strain of the virus than what caused the molluscum contagiosum and skin tag. \n\nThe lipid profile and CBC results are within the normal range, so it is unlikely that any underlying health condition is contributing to your infection. The amylase level is slightly elevated, but it is likely not related to the infection. The Helicobacter pylori IgA test result is negative, so it is unlikely that you have an infection in your stomach. The urine test shows pus cells, which could be a sign of a urinary tract infection. \n\nIt is possible that the multiple sex partners are contributing to your infection. It is also possible that you have a weakened immune system due to stress or other factors, making it easier for you to get infected. \n\nIt is important to continue taking the medicines prescribed by",

GERD is a condition where the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) does not close properly and stomach contents including acid are regurgitated up into the esophagus.

High levels of protein in the urine, elevated serum creatinine, and high albumin to creatinine ratio all suggest kidney damage. The cause of your kidney disease may be due to high blood pressure, diabetes, or hepatitis B. It is important to get these conditions under control in order to slow the progression of kidney disease. You should also get regular checkups to monitor your kidney function and take any necessary steps to protect your kidney health.",

So, I thought I would consult with you on another question pertaining to my son. Unfortunately, a combination of my health anxiety and the big mistake of searching online has my mind imagining the worst with regard to my son. My son is 19 years old and has no diagnosed medical issues. I noticed back when he was about eight or ten years old that he had a mark resembling a cafe au lait mark on his back, in the upper shoulder area. I had always asked the pediatrician to look at it during his yearly physicals, and they made nothing of it. Throughout the years it has grown a bit and has become darker and more rough in texture. It is probably slightly less than an inch in length and looks like a few small lesions grouped together. Again, I have brought it to the pediatrician\\s attention and he was not concerned. Three months ago, I made an appointment for him and my other son with a dermatologist for a skin exam, and I pointed out the spots which I wanted to be checked in particular. We met with the physician\\s assistant there, and my younger son had a peculiar spot I pointed out, of which the PA conducted a shave biopsy, which came back as a mildly atypical junctional nevus. For my older son, I pointed out the spot on his back/shoulder, and the PA diagnosed it as a linear epidermal nevus. She said the chances of it becoming dangerous are slim to none. It may darken throughout the years, and they will simply monitor it at yearly visits. Unfortunately, I went on to research online about epidermal nevi and of course I ran into information showing a possible link to epidermal nevus syndrome and all of its associated neurological and skeletal defects. As I said, he is 19 and has no medical issues, is extremely intelligent, etc. In your opinion, is it safe to say that I should not be concerned about those syndromes? I presume it is primarily related to the numerous and systemic epidermal nevi, which he does not have, and I would think it would have presented by now? And my last even more neurotic question. My online research led me to some information saying that a certain type of epidermal nevus could be related to a gene mutation that could be passed along to an offspring, with them having possible serious skin scaling conditions, etc. Again, he has just one solitary small epidermal nevus. No biopsy was done, as the PA did not feel it was necessary. Do you feel there is any need for me to worry about that potential genetic mutation? Thank you so much for reading my long query.",

The risk of genetic transmission of a gene mutation leading to serious skin scaling conditions is also very low. He should continue to have yearly checkups with the dermatologist to monitor the nevus, and if it changes in any way or begins to cause any discomfort, he should come in for evaluation.",

I started limping because my left calf, ankle and groin were hurting. My emergency Doppler venous ultrasound was clear. I had a D-dimer and that was negative. I had an MRI of my left ankle that showed a talofibular ligament sprain on my left ankle. I also had an arterial Doppler ultrasound that showed decreased flow of left anterior tibial artery and increased peak systolic velocity in the left common femoral artery. But, there was no stenosis, no sclerosis and no plaque. Could the sprain have caused that decreased flow? After three months, it became normal again. Then, while having pedicure the woman massaged my ankle and leg. Since then the pain has returned to my left ankle and left leg. I had another D-dimer done three weeks ago that was negative. I have also recently started experiencing cold left foot and a left cold lower leg at night. By morning, both the legs as well as the feet are of the same temperature.

The pedicure may have aggravated the symptoms due to increased pressure on the leg. The D-dimer test is used to rule out a blood clot in the veins, not the arteries. The arterial Doppler ultrasound is the best test to evaluate for a blood clot in the arteries. The LDL being 10 points above the normal range could be a concern, as it could increase the risk of developing cardiovascular disease. It is best to consult a cardiologist to evaluate the possibility of a blood clot in the arteries. It is safe to fly, but it is best to consult a doctor before the flight.",

When I touch my cheek, pain shoots down to my tooth and I do not know what this means.\n\n### Response:It sounds like you may have an abscessed tooth. An abscess is a buildup of pus that forms in the center of a tooth or at the end of a tooth's root. It is usually caused by a bacterial infection that can be painful and can lead to more serious issues if left untreated. The swelling in your cheek is likely related to the infection and should be evaluated by a medical professional as soon as possible. You should also schedule an appointment with your dentist to have the tooth examined and treated. In the meantime, you can take over-the-counter pain medications and apply a warm compress to the area to help reduce swelling and pain.",

His T3 and T4 levels are within the normal range but his TSH level is slightly low, which could be indicative of an under-dose of thyroxine. It is important to ensure his thyroid hormone levels are properly balanced to avoid any further complications.

It sounds like you are already doing a lot of healthy activities, but need some guidance on how to optimize your diet. A healthy diet for a vegetarian should include plenty of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, nuts and legumes, lean proteins, and healthy fats. A good way to start the day is with a hearty breakfast, such as oatmeal with nuts and dried fruit, or a smoothie with yogurt and berries. For lunch and dinner, focus on vegetable-based dishes, such as steamed greens and roasted vegetables, along with a lean protein source such as tofu or fish, and some healthy fats like nuts, avocado, or olive oil. Aim to eat every three to four hours throughout the day, and make sure to drink plenty of water. During the times you are sitting at your office, it is important to stay active by taking breaks and walking around. Best of luck!",

Panic attacks are sudden episodes of intense fear or discomfort that reach a peak within a few minutes and then subside. They can be very frightening and distressing, and can lead to feelings of being out of control. It is possible that you are experiencing panic attacks even when you are not stressed, as they can be caused by physical or emotional triggers.

She had a fibroids operation seven years back. Before the operation, she was very active but after this, her health has gradually deteriorated.

This could be causing her psychological issues and the other symptoms you described. I suggest that you take her to a psychiatrist who can help her manage her stress and anxiety. In addition, she may need physical therapy to help her regain some of her mobility and independence.",

I always had stomach issues but now at the end of the day I have terrible gas trouble, and it does not matter what I eat. Beano helps a little. Could this be IBS?Lab tests performed: All lab test are normal.\n\n### Response:Based on the patient's description, it is likely that they have Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). IBS is a common disorder of the digestive system that affects the large intestine and causes symptoms such as gas, abdominal pain, and changes in bowel habits. Beano may help reduce the symptoms of IBS by breaking down certain complex sugars in the intestine. It is likely that the patient's symptoms are being caused by a change in the normal bacteria in the gut, which can occur with age. There is no cure for IBS, but diet and lifestyle changes can help manage the symptoms.",

This type of pain is caused by a bruise or inflammation of the iliac crest, which is the top portion of the hip bone. The pain usually resolves on its own with rest and pain relief medications, although a physiotherapy program may be helpful in speeding up the healing process. The patient should also take steps to prevent further injury, such as avoiding heavy objects, taking breaks when possible, and ensuring good posture when sitting for long periods.

These are caused by strands of collagen or other substances in the vitreous humor of the eye that cast shadows when they fall in front of the retina. This condition is usually benign and does not require treatment, however it is best to get it checked by an ophthalmologist to rule out any potential serious causes. The aching and gnawing pains the patient experiences may be related to the astigmatism in the right eye, and could be relieved with corrective lenses or other treatments. It is also possible that the aches are caused by eyestrain due to the bright lighting or screens, in which case wearing glasses that block blue light and taking regular breaks may help.",

Her mood swings and anger could be symptoms of a deeper issue, such as depression or anxiety, that needs to be addressed. It is also concerning that she is threatening divorce and blaming your family for doing black magic. It is important that she gets the help she needs, either through therapy or other forms of support. In the meantime, it is important that you show her love and support and make sure she knows that you are there for her.",

Rubella is a contagious disease and you should avoid contact with people who are not immune to it. As for CMV and HSV 1 and 2, since the IgG antibodies are present, it means that you have been exposed to these viruses in the past but are not currently infected. You should get retested if you have any new symptoms. \n3. It is advisable to use protection during sexual activities to prevent any possible transmission of the viruses. \n4. Treatment for TORCH IgG positive results depends on the severity of the infection. Your doctor will be able to provide the best course of action.",

The presence of follicles in the ovarian parenchyma is normal. \n3. The thick septation is likely due to the accumulation of fluid and debris within the cyst, and is a normal finding.\n4. The echogenic lesions within the lumen are likely calcifications, which are common in ovarian cysts and are usually benign.\n5.

Your son can try to modify his grip on the racket to reduce the strain on the elbow, and he should also do stretching and strengthening exercises for the forearm muscles. Both of you should also take care to ensure good posture and avoid any repetitive strain injuries. A physiotherapist may be able to provide more specific advice and exercises.",

Flovent was increased to 88 mcg twice daily, Albuterol 2.5mg every four hours for 48 hours and Prednisolone 15mg/5ml one and a half tablespoon once daily for five days. She seems to be having retractions at night between 10 PM and 2 AM like clockwork. They are not severe as her respiration rate is 22-28, pulse oximeter reading is 96-98%. Pulse is elevated at times due to Albuterol and the highest recorded is 160 with no fever. She is tired and is pale in the face with dark circles under her eyes.I followed up with the pediatrician yesterday and he diagnosed her with an ear infection and put her on Augmentin.

The subcostal retractions, occasional constriction in the throat, and productive cough are all common symptoms of asthma. The Augmentin prescribed by the pediatrician may be helping to clear up the ear infection, but it is likely not enough to control the asthma flare. I would recommend increasing the Flovent dose to 110 mcg twice daily and adding a long-acting bronchodilator such as Salmeterol 50 mcg twice daily. You should also continue the Albuterol as needed and the Prednisolone 15 mg/5 ml once daily. If her symptoms do not improve within a few days, then I recommend taking her to the emergency room for further evaluation and treatment.",

The symptoms of throat pain when swallowing, cough with mucus and fever are all indicative of an infection. Erythromycin is an antibiotic, so it is likely that the infection has been caused by a bacteria. I would recommend that your wife visits her doctor to get a proper diagnosis and treatment. The doctor may prescribe her a different antibiotic if the infection has not been cleared by the Erythromycin. They may also recommend pain relief medication and/or a throat lozenge. Additionally, they may suggest gargling with salt water or using a humidifier to help ease the symptoms. I hope your wife feels better soon.",

I recommend that you take a pregnancy test again in a few days and consult a doctor if the symptoms persist.",

The best way to speed up the healing process is to keep the wound clean and covered with a clean, dry dressing. Smoking and drinking alcohol can delay healing, so it is best to avoid these. It is also important to ensure that you are eating a balanced diet to promote healing. It is possible that the wound may require a skin graft if it does not improve in the next few weeks.",

Additionally, a full body CT scan should be done to look for possible lymph node involvement. If lymphoma is suspected, it is important to begin treatment as soon as possible.",

It is best to see a doctor in person to get a proper diagnosis and treatment. In the meantime, you can try to reduce the inflammation and pain by applying warm compresses several times a day. You can also use over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or paracetamol. It is best to avoid using topical antibiotics like Mupirocin without seeing a doctor, as this could lead to antibiotic resistance. You should also consider avoiding shaving the area, as this can introduce bacteria into the wound. It is best to consult a doctor in person to get the best advice for your specific situation.",

It is possible that you have ruptured your ACL again, and it is best to consult your surgeon and physiotherapist as soon as possible. The Lelli test being positive with good leverage does not necessarily mean that your ACL is intact, as other structures such as the PCL and MCL can also contribute to the stability of the knee joint.

It is likely that the rash is a fungal infection, and the medications you have been prescribed are appropriate for treating it. It is best to continue using the medications until the symptoms have totally gone, as this will ensure that the infection is completely treated. You should also use the medications only once per day, as using them twice per day could increase the risk of side effects.

It is generally safe to touch the affected area after a shower, but it is best to be careful when washing your hair or face to avoid getting the medication in your eyes. To help prevent the rash from coming back, it is important to keep the skin clean and dry, wear loose fitting clothing, and avoid irritating products.",

I consulted a doctor and he prescribed me Qosmet 500 mg/ 50mg twice a day and Amaryl 1 mg once in the morning. After a week, my sugar was under control and blood sugar fasting was 93 mg/dL and random was 111 mg/dL and 139 mg/dL. Three days I was fine but after that, I am feeling vertigo (dizziness). Kindly tell me why this is happening to me. Is it any side effect of the tablet I am taking or any other issue?\n\n### Response:It is likely that the dizziness is a side effect of the medication. It is possible that the dose needs to be adjusted or that a different medication may be more effective. It is best to consult a doctor to determine the best course of action.",

The brown spotting with blood clots could be due to old blood getting expelled from the body. The slight bleeding after your recent protected intercourse could be due to irritation of the vaginal walls. The orgasm leading to bleeding could be due to increased blood flow to the area. It is possible that the irregular cycle and late period could be due to hormonal changes or stress. It is best to get tested for pregnancy and other sexually transmitted infections. Additionally, you should consult a gynecologist to determine the cause of your irregular cycle and late period.",

Can you please advise if the tablet will work or not?\n\n### Response:It is likely that the I-pill will work, as your wife took it within the recommended time frame. However, it is always best to use condoms to prevent any potential pregnancies. If you are concerned, you should get your wife checked out by a doctor to make sure the I-pill was effective.",

After this window period, HIV tests are considered conclusive and can provide a definitive negative or positive result. In your case, since it has been 20 months since your potential exposure and you have already taken two HIV tests which both came back negative, it is highly unlikely that you have contracted HIV. It is very unlikely that the virus can take more than two years to show up in a test, so you can be confident that you are HIV-negative.",

I have had folliculitis before in the same area and it was much different. She is the doctor. So I accepted and moved on. One small spot that has some hair growing back, small thin white hair. Yesterday, I noticed what appeared to be a bald spot in my pubic hair above the penis. When I trimmed the hair back, it revealed a quarter sized bald spot and a smaller dime sized spot. I am not sure how long they may have been there as they were somewhat masked by a longer pubic hair. So, now I have what I believe to be three spots, two below abdomen and one on beard. My concern is more of them spreading than the current spots.I am now thinking back about the annual checkup that I had with my GP six months back. I advised him that in the past year the amount of semen I produce has gone down drastically. I thought it may be a testosterone issue. He advised it was likely a result of my vasectomy the year before. Also as a part of my visit, my WBC was lower than normal, outside of the range by a couple. He was not concerned about that either.My question is whether any of these things are related: decrease in semen, low WBC, and alopecia in pubic area or all separate issues? I see no reason to go back to the dermatologist as my new spots are hidden. Based on these separate facts, is there any likelihood they are related and is there any reason to see a doctor?",

It was likely alopecia areata. Saw my dermatologist last week, she said it was likely folliculitis. I have had folliculitis before in the same area and it was much different. She is the doctor. So I accepted and moved on. One small spot that has some hair growing back, small thin white hair. Yesterday, I noticed what appeared to be a bald spot in my pubic hair above the penis. When I trimmed the hair back, it revealed a quarter sized bald spot and a smaller dime sized spot. I am not sure how long they may have been there as they were somewhat masked by a longer pubic hair. So, now I have what I believe to be three spots, two below abdomen and one on beard. My concern is more of them spreading than the current spots.I am now thinking back about the annual checkup that I had with my GP six months back. I advised him that in the past year the amount of semen I produce has gone down drastically. I thought it may be a testosterone issue. He advised it was likely a result of my vasectomy the year before. Also as a part of my visit, my WBC was lower than normal, outside of the range by a couple. He was not concerned about that either.My question is whether any of these things are related: decrease in semen, low WBC, and alopecia in pubic area or all separate issues? I see no reason to go back to the dermatologist as my new spots are hidden. Based on these separate facts, is there any likelihood they are related and is there any reason to see a doctor?\n\n### Response:It is possible that the alopecia areata and folliculitis are related. It is also possible that the decrease in semen and low WBC are related. It is likely that the alopecia areata and decrease in semen are related, as alopecia areata can be caused by an autoimmune disorder and low testosterone levels can lead to a decrease in semen. It is also possible that the folliculitis and low WBC are related, as certain infections can cause both of these conditions. It is possible that the alopecia areata, folliculitis, and decrease in semen are related, as they could all be caused by an underlying autoimmune disorder. It is also possible that the alopecia areata, folliculitis, and low WBC are related, as they could all be caused by an infection. \n\nIt is advisable to see a doctor to get to the root of the issue. A blood test can be done to check your testosterone levels, and a biopsy can be done to confirm the diagnosis of alopecia areata. Your doctor may also prescribe steroids or other treatments to help with the alopecia areata. If an infection is causing the folliculitis and low WBC, then antibiotics will likely be prescribed. If an autoimmune disorder is causing",

This situation has taken place twice. I do not have soft drinks, coffee, and chocolates. I am very upset about this situation. Please help.\n\n### Response:It sounds like you may be dealing with dental calculus, which is a hardened plaque that can form on the teeth. It is composed of bacteria, food particles, and saliva. It can be removed through scaling, but it often comes back. To help prevent it from coming back, it is important to practice good oral hygiene, such as brushing and flossing your teeth at least twice a day. Additionally, avoiding soft drinks, coffee, and chocolates will also help. If the deposits continue to be a problem, you should consider visiting your dentist for further advice and treatment.",

I did go to the hospital to get it treated. The doctor cut off half of my nail, cleaned and dressed it, and kept re-visiting to get the dressing changed. The doctor said that I could stop re-visiting. And then she told me that the nail would have to be removed again after it grows back fully. But, I am hesitant and kind of rejecting to do so.After a month, the nail is not loose anymore, but the nail seems to be growing outwards, and between the nail and the nail bed, there is a gap (kind of like a hollow gap inside). Should I just wait until the nail fully grows back? Should I cut it? What should I do? I am really worried that it will not grow and it will completely fall off once I start wearing shoes. Please note: I am going on a horse riding and hiking camp the next month. Just in case if it does not grow back by then, what should I do or wear to protect it?",

Just in case if it does not grow back by then, what should I do or wear to protect it?\n\n### Response:It sounds like you have a partial avulsion injury to your toenail, which is when the nail plate is partially ripped away from the nail bed. It is important to protect the nail bed to ensure that the nail grows back properly. You can try to trim the nail and file down the sharp edges, but it is best to have a healthcare professional do this to make sure it is done properly. You should also keep the area clean and dry, and apply an antibiotic ointment to the area to prevent infection. You can also try to gently push the nail back into place, but again, it is best to have a healthcare professional do this. If the nail does not grow back in time for your camping trip, you can try to protect it by wearing appropriate shoes and/or a bandage. Good luck!",

This is because the eye power can change over time, and it is important to monitor it closely. There are treatments available to slow down the progression of myopia, such as orthokeratology and atropine eye drops. These treatments are usually more effective when started at an early age, so it may be beneficial to discuss these options with the eye doctor. Swinging of eyes may improve with time, but it is best to consult an eye doctor to be sure.",

Any ideas on why this is happening, presumably 3-4 days past ovulation?Is this cause for concern?

There are no surefire ways to prevent moles from appearing, but there are some things you can do to slow down the process. Avoid prolonged sun exposure, wear sunscreen, and protect your skin with clothing. Also, make sure to do regular self-examinations of your skin so that you can catch any new moles early and have them checked by a doctor.",

        "input": "Hi doctor,I am a 23 year old male, a third-year medical student. For the past seven days, I have had an increased urgency and frequency to urinate. I can go even more than 30 times a day - majority of these times, I feel an increased urgency. However, when I go, only a small amount or drops come out. For the past two to three days, the urgency kind of feels to be getting worse, I feel as if I will not be able to hold it. However, I am still able to as there is no leaking. There is no burning or irritation or any discharge. No recent sexual encounters and no other associated symptoms. I take Coveram 10/10 for essential hypertension and Valdoxan 25 because I also do suffer from anxiety. I have been under stress lately as I was doing my exams this past week and finished today. I have done a few tests at my family doctor: Last week I did a dipstick which was normal apart from +1 protein. Voiding bladder US was normal (450 mL pre voiding, 45 mL post voiding). An initial urine culture was normal according to my doctor. Yesterday, I performed another dipstick and urine culture. The dipstick was normal, and early urine microscopy showed 10 to 100 white cell count. We are waiting for the cultures to return. Due to the result of the white cell count, my doctor said it would be worth a try to undergo a 5-day course of antibiotics (Keflex).Today is my third day of antibiotic treatment, symptoms are largely the same. Today, I attempted to hold my bladder. It felt fine in the morning but as the day went on, my symptoms returned and I am finding it harder to hold my bladder. Also, for the first time, I tried going for a run. The entire time I felt a heaviness in my bladder and felt a strong urge to urinate, even though I went before my run began. What do you think could be going on? My doctor believes that it is either a UTI, or most likely, a hypersensitive bladder due to exam stress. However, there have been days where I have not felt stress at all yet symptoms have continued. I am really worried as I want to go back to work in five days and I do not think I will be able to manage the way things are at the moment. My family doctor does think this will settle down now that I have finished exams. Do you think there is a chance it could? I have mentioned this query to another doctor online, and he believed it may be due to an overactive bladder. However, since I am relatively young to receive this diagnosis, I wanted a second opinion, if that is alright. Do you think this could be OAB? I am worried that it could be something serious, like multiple sclerosis. One and a half years ago, I had an episode of sudden onset numbness in one arm and fearing the same thing, I ended up having an MRI of my brain and lumbar spine which both came back negative. Do you think this could be MS?",

This is a common condition that affects many people, particularly those who are otherwise healthy. It is characterized by a sudden and frequent urge to urinate, even when the bladder is not full. It can be caused by stress, caffeine, or medications, but in your case it is likely due to the exam stress. It is possible that the symptoms may resolve on their own, but if they do not improve within a few days, it is best to seek medical attention. It is unlikely that this is due to multiple sclerosis, but if the symptoms persist or worsen, it is best to get checked by a doctor. Good luck!",

This could be due to your increased physical activity, or it could be a sign of an underlying health condition. It is best to get this checked by a doctor to rule out any potential health concerns. A full blood test may be necessary to get to the root of the issue. Your hemoglobin level of 16 is slightly low, and so it would be beneficial to get this checked as well.",

Marrying your maternal cousin creates a first-order relationship, which is not considered to be as risky as a second-order relationship (marrying your maternal uncle's daughter). Generally, the risk of genetic defects is higher in second-order relationships due to the shared grandparents. However, it is still recommended that you and your wife get tested for any potential genetic disorders before having children. This can be done through prenatal testing.",

My doctor arrived at the 4 mg per day amount gradually and it works very well along with CBT from a therapist. Before two months, when I received the medication from the pharmacy it was for 3 mg /day. I asked them to double check and that was the quantity that my doctor had written. I call his office and the office manager said that she would ask him about it. When I called the next day she said that he did not make a mistake and I asked for an explanation and was told that he did not give one.I started to feel sick a few days later and panic attacks actually started to increase the day that I talk to his office manager. I suffered minor but disruptive withdrawal symptoms physically and mentally for about two weeks and then they subsided but panic attacks continued to occur at random every day and my GAD symptoms increased to the point where CBT methods were not working.Then last month, the script was back to 4 mg per day normal dosage. I thought yes, back to normal. But again this month the script was back down to 3 mg per day which means I am going to experience a minor hell again.I am a defense and aerospace engineer who works on a contract basis through an agency and the client had noticed a drop in my performance before month but back to normal last month, now they are going to see it again and I will probably lose the contract job. I also started online system engineer classes and I am freaking out over being able to handle the exams and homework as I typically work on the class at night and am now without my evening dose.

It is possible that your doctor was trying to reduce your dosage in order to taper your Xanax use, which is a common practice for treating anxiety. However, it is also possible that he made an error in prescribing the lower dosage. It is also possible that the lower dosage is causing withdrawal symptoms, which can be very unpleasant. It is important to talk to your doctor about your concerns and to make sure that you are taking the correct dosage. It is also important to be aware of the risks associated with Xanax use and to make sure that you are not taking more than the recommended amount. Good luck!",

I want to get an opinion about this before thinking about Ahmed valve.\n\n### Response:Given your mother's medical history, it is best to consult an ophthalmologist who specializes in glaucoma treatment. The doctor will be able to give you the best advice on which surgical option is the most suitable for your mother. The Xen Gel Stent and InnFocus Microshunt are both minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) procedures that are safe and effective. The Ahmed valve implant is also a good option, but it does carry some risks. It is best to weigh the risks and benefits of each procedure before making a decision.",

Although my BMI says that I am on the normal side, it still made me upset because the belly, arms, and legs have gotten bigger. So I started doing minimal resistance training and changed my eating habits for three weeks already. I noticed that my legs look leaner but my upper body is still the same. This made me anxious because it might have something to do with my insulin medications and I cannot go to an actual dietician since they were still on quarantine so I thought someone might be able to help me online.

It is possible that the resistance training is helping to reduce the fat in your legs, but it may be that your diet is not optimized for your diabetes and insulin use. It is important to ensure that your diet is providing enough nutrients, while still controlling your blood sugar levels. A dietician would be best placed to advise you on this, as they will have experience working with diabetic patients. They will be able to provide you with tailored advice that takes into account your medical condition, lifestyle and dietary preferences. In the meantime, it may be beneficial to consult with your doctor to ensure that your insulin doses are still appropriate for your current body composition and activity levels.",

Please advice. The x-ray and MRI reports are normal.\n\n### Response:It is likely that you have developed ankle instability as a result of the previous ankle fracture. This can be confirmed with physical examination. The sharp stabbing pain and burning sensation could be due to inflammation and tiny microtears in the ankle joint. Resting for a week may have reduced the inflammation, but it has not resolved the underlying issue. Climbing stairs is difficult because the instability leads to a sense of \u201closing the ankle\u201d and the body\u2019s natural response is to protect the joint by limiting activity. \n\nI recommend that you see a doctor for physical examination and possible referral to a physical therapist for ankle stabilization exercises. If the instability is not addressed, it can lead to further damage to the ankle joint and chronic pain.",

So, I called and asked them about it. They said I will be asleep, but if they ask me to raise my hand, I will be able to do that. What on earth are they giving me? I want to be asleep during the entire procedure. Will IV sedation do that?\n\n### Response:IV sedation will make you drowsy and may cause you to forget parts of the procedure. It will not put you to sleep completely, so you will be able to respond to requests from the doctor and the nurses. If you would like to be asleep during the entire procedure, you may want to consider general anesthesia instead. This will put you in a deep sleep and you will not be able to respond to any requests or commands. Talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of both sedation methods so you can make an informed decision.",

Since you have PCOS, there is a risk of OHSS, so it is important to be monitored closely during the treatment. You do not need to take long breaks from work, but it is advisable to take some time off during the egg retrieval and embryo transfer. Bed rest after embryo transfer is not necessary, but you should take some time off to rest during the two-week wait. A single embryo transfer is recommended in order to reduce the risk of multiple pregnancies.",

However, severe pain still persists, no improvement from the pain felt two weeks post-injury. Does this indicate it is not healing?\n\n### Response:It is possible that the PCL tear has not healed yet. It is common for symptoms to take up to 3 months to resolve after an injury. It is also possible that there is an underlying issue, such as a meniscal tear, that is contributing to the pain and delaying the healing process. I would recommend having another MRI done to check for any additional injuries and then consulting with a specialist to determine the best course of treatment. In the meantime, you can continue with the physiotherapy and strengthening exercises.",

The crown was removed and cleaned by the Hygienist with a Listerine or Peroxide mix. There were food particles and they cleared the food particles present in the crown. My dentist advised me to take tablet Zyrtec every day. The teeth still have a dull type of pain. Could it be an issue of the crown that has not been shown on the X-ray or there is any allergies?",

The Endodontist has done root canal treatment in these teeth and crowns were placed after the treatment. Recently, I experienced pain around the gums in the second molar and there is a pain radiating to the head. I went to my dentist. He examined and took an X-ray which looked fine.

My dentist advised me to take tablet Zyrtec every day. The teeth still have a dull type of pain. Could it be an issue of the crown that has not been shown on the X-ray or there is any allergies?\n\n### Response:It is possible that the pain is related to the crown. It is also possible that the pain is related to an allergic reaction to the materials used in the crown. It is difficult to say without examining you in person, so I recommend that you follow up with an allergist to determine the cause of your symptoms. In the meantime, you can try taking over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or paracetamol, to help manage the discomfort.",

The amount of blood you are losing during your period (25-30 pads per cycle) is certainly within the range of heavy menstrual bleeding. \n\nFor your upcoming visit to the gynecologist, it is best to prepare by wearing comfortable clothing that will allow access to your abdomen and pelvic area. You may also want to ask a friend or family member to accompany you for support. The gynecologist will likely perform a physical examination, including a pelvic exam, and may order additional tests such as an ultrasound. Depending on the results of the exam and tests, the gynecologist may recommend treatments such as hormonal contraceptives, intrauterine device (IUD), or medications.",

The best treatment for this condition is to use a gentle exfoliating product twice a day, use a moisturizer with lactic acid or retinol, and use a body scrub in the shower.

It is also possible that the increase in sound sensitivity is causing increased muscle tension and pins and needles in your legs. \n\nThe NCS and VEMP tests suggest that there is nothing physically wrong with your nerves, which is good news.

Please help.\n\n### Response:It is possible that the chiropractor is correct and the muscle spasm and pain are related to the hip being tilted forward. You could try applying heat or ice to the area, or taking an over-the-counter pain reliever. You should also try to gently stretch and massage the area. If the pain does not improve within a few days, you should consult a medical professional.",

I sought advice from friends and groups and nurses, that have trigeminal neuralgia and they suggest Carbamazepine.I learned it lowers Lamictal.

She is not a pain doctor or neurologist. I am waiting to see one. But my condition makes it hard to travel in a car. My doctor asked I seek advice. Do you agree that checking the serum and adjusting is fine to do, in order to take Carbamazepine?The second option is Oxcarbazepine. In your experience is it a good pain drug for TN and does it mess up Lamictal? I found a study that said it did not.I was thinking I could start it now while I wait on Lamictal levels. And see if it helps. Just really struggling. Pain cream not helping much in certain places. My old neurologist wanted me to lower Glutamate as much as I could and suggested Namenda at one point.

Oxcarbazepine is also a good option for trigeminal neuralgia and should not interfere with Lamictal. It is important to start at a low dose and gradually increase it while monitoring your levels. In addition to medications, injections for the pain may be a good option. You may also want to consider other treatments such as physical therapy, acupuncture, or biofeedback. I would definitely recommend speaking to your doctor before starting any new medications or treatments. Good luck!",

Is this hike in the value of Rubella IgG and CMV IgG the cause of miscarriage? Please guide us.\n\n### Response:Yes, it is likely that the high levels of Rubella IgG and CMV IgG detected in the TORCH test were the cause of the miscarriage. Rubella and CMV are both known to cause miscarriage and other fetal abnormalities if contracted during pregnancy. The presence of Rubella IgM antibodies indicates that your wife had a recent infection, which could have caused the miscarriage. The same is true for the CMV antibodies. It is recommended that you and your wife get tested for these infections again after a few months and before attempting another pregnancy.",

The best way to fix this is to visit a dentist, who can assess the damage and recommend a suitable treatment. This may involve a filling, crown or root canal, depending on how much of the tooth is damaged. In the meantime, you can relieve the pain by rinsing your mouth with warm salt water and using over-the-counter pain medications.",

Initially, she got eczema kind small red rashes for which we applied Corticosteroid and later we observed whitish patches developing on those spots. Initially, the GP thought it could be tinea versicolor and suspected it could also be vitiligo.He referred us to a skin specialist and initially, the skin specialist thought it could be hypopigmentation and after a month, in the next appointment, she thought it could be vitiligo and started with Tacrolimus and Corticosteroid cream.Even before we started applying this Tacrolimus, we saw some repigmentation in some areas but it was slow repigmentation. We were confused as is it vitiligo or not and also as we are applying strong creams for a 6-year-old girl. Any long-term issues?We want to have a second opinion. I live in a city where it is very difficult to get skin specialist appointments. They give for every three to six months. Could you please help us in diagnosing the skin patches and treatment? I can send in the photos. I uploaded the photos:They all are on one side of the body (right side).On the hand, it started four months ago with a small white patch and gradually increased to the size and then we are seeing some repigmentation slowly very slowly to normal skin color.On the chest also, it started around the same time this year and not increased and stable.On the neck, it started early last month and it is not that whitish (like little less brownish).As said, the doctors diagnosed differently (postinflammatory hypopigmentation, tinea versicolor and finally vitiligo) so far and we are confused.

This is a skin condition characterized by areas of skin that become lighter in color than the surrounding skin, usually due to inflammation, trauma, or irritation. The lesions may be treated with topical corticosteroids, anti-inflammatories, and/or antibiotics, depending on the cause. It is likely that the lesions will gradually improve with time. The eye lesion may be vitiligo, which is a long-term skin condition characterized by patches of discolored skin. It is usually treatable, so it is recommended that the patient consults a dermatologist for further evaluation and treatment.",

The lump you feel is a pooling of blood and other fluids from the damaged muscle. It is likely that the area is tender to pressure because the muscle is inflamed. It is not advisable to move the arm too much or put pressure on the area as this could further inflame the muscle and cause more damage. You should rest the area and apply ice packs for 15-20 minutes at a time to help reduce the inflammation and pain. Over the counter pain medications such as ibuprofen can also be used to help reduce the inflammation and pain. If the symptoms do not improve or get worse, then it is advisable to seek medical attention.",

I recommend that you visit an eye specialist as soon as possible to get a more accurate diagnosis and an appropriate treatment. In the meantime, you should stop using the current eye drops and consult your doctor before using any other medications. Additionally, you should get plenty of rest and avoid straining your eyes by using electronics or reading for long periods of time.",

The best course of action would be to remove the contact lens and start an appropriate course of eye drops and ointment. The swelling and redness may take a few days to resolve. It is also important to avoid wearing contact lenses until the infection has completely cleared up. You should also avoid going to crowded places and wash your hands frequently to prevent the infection from spreading.",

Saw that it could cause a QT prolongation. So, just wanted to make sure this was not occurring.\n\n### Response:It is normal to be cautious when starting a new medication. It is reassuring that the EKGs came back as normal. It is important to be aware that Citalopram can cause a QT prolongation, so it is a good idea to keep an eye out for any changes in your heart rhythm. If you notice any changes, please contact your doctor right away. Additionally, it is recommended that you have your electrolytes and kidney function checked prior to starting the medication and then periodically while you are taking it. This can help ensure that your body is able to tolerate the medication safely.",

Increasing the dose can often help with this, but it can also take some time for the full effect to kick in. It may be worth speaking to your doctor about other treatment options, or increasing the dose further.",

There were other endocrine-related findings as well. In the course of various endocrine-related treatments and corresponding blood work, I began iron supplementation in the form of ferrous sulfate 143 mg daily. I began this before the blood work was done. So, you can see that that the levels have increased. Subsequent testing, a month later, showed a decline despite continuing treatment. Most recently, you can see that the levels are back up. Note that the ferritin levels began a bit low around 27 ng/mL and had increased to 30 ng/mL.I have received a wide range of conflicting advice about whether low iron levels in the absence of anemia can cause fatigue.

It is understandable that you are hesitant to pursue surgery, as there are risks associated with any surgical procedure. It is difficult to make a recommendation without examining you, but it may be worth discussing with your doctor the potential benefits and risks of a laminectomy in more detail. Additionally, you may want to consider talking to another specialist for a second opinion.",

Being separated from a parent can be stressful for young children and can cause them to feel anxious or insecure. This can lead to increased crying, difficulty sleeping, and changes in appetite. It is possible that this could lead to psychological problems if not addressed, so it is important to be mindful of your son\u2019s reactions. Allowing him to visit the daycare while you stay nearby may help him adjust, as he will know you are nearby. If possible, it may be best for your son to stay with you or your in-laws, as this would provide the most consistent and secure environment for him.",

The problem is that I have developed extreme sensitivity to most of the drugs, medication, treatment. In the past, there were many instances of adverse reactions by taking medicines of Iron composition. These include restlessness, breathing problem, and diarrhea. About five years ago, upon the doctor's advice and supervision, I was fed intravenously through saline bottle with some Iron injection to it. Immediately in about 15 minutes after the procedure, I experienced shortness of breath, burning sensation in muscles, swelling of legs, fatigue, and diarrhea. It subsided when I was given an antidote by the doctor immediately. From then onwards I was reluctant to take any of my medicines and undergo any treatment. I just focussed on improving my diet. Recently upon doctor's advice, I took some medical tests and the reports were serum ferritin: 3.0 ng/mL, vitamin B12: 129 pg/mL, TSH: 0.02 \\xb5IU/mL (but T3/T4 tests are fine), iron: 15 \\xb5g/dL, TIBC: 527 \\xb5g/dL, hemoglobin 7.7 g/dL, vitamin D: 18.39 ng/mL. I was also informed that I developed food allergy to some foods. Lately, I am experiencing a headache with activity, unexplained generalized weakness, fatigue most of the time.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.\n\n### Input:\nHello doctor,I am a 49-year-old woman. I am suffering from severe anemia (iron and B12 deficiency). This might be the result of prolonged malnutrition over the past few years. The problem is that I have developed extreme sensitivity to most of the drugs, medication, treatment. In the past, there were many instances of adverse reactions by taking medicines of Iron composition. These include restlessness, breathing problem, and diarrhea. About five years ago, upon the doctor's advice and supervision, I was fed intravenously through saline bottle with some Iron injection to it. Immediately in about 15 minutes after the procedure, I experienced shortness of breath, burning sensation in muscles, swelling of legs, fatigue, and diarrhea. It subsided when I was given an antidote by the doctor immediately. From then onwards I was reluctant to take any of my medicines and undergo any treatment. I just focussed on improving my diet. Recently upon doctor's advice, I took some medical tests and the reports were serum ferritin: 3.0 ng/mL, vitamin B12: 129 pg/mL, TSH: 0.02 \\xb5IU/mL (but T3/T4 tests are fine), iron: 15 \\xb5g/dL, TIBC: 527 \\xb5g/dL, hemoglobin 7.7 g/dL, vitamin D: 18.39 ng/mL. I was also informed that I developed food allergy to some foods. Lately, I am experiencing a headache with activity, unexplained generalized weakness, fatigue most of the time. According to the doctor, I am in a very critical position and should be immediately treated with Iron injections, blood transfusion, etc. But, I am really worried as my body will not be able to take these treatments (as I faced adverse reactions in the past). Are there any medical procedures or treatments on which I can rely upon ensuring that they will not have any adverse effects after the treatment. Please help me.\n\n### Response:Given your medical history, it is understandable that you are concerned about any potential adverse reactions to treatments. It is fortunate that you have already had some tests done and that your TSH, T3/T4, and vitamin D levels are all within the normal range. This suggests that your anemia is most likely due to iron and B12 deficiencies.\n\nGiven your sensitivity to medications, it is advisable to seek out more natural treatments for your anemia. Eating a nutrient-dense, iron-rich diet is a great place to start. Foods high in iron include spinach, oysters, lentils, beans, and legumes. Additionally, B12 is found naturally in animal products such as meat, fish, poultry, eggs and dairy. If you are unable to consume these foods, you may want to consider taking supplements.\n\nIt is also important to stay hydrated and get regular exercise. Regular physical activity can help boost your energy levels and improve your overall health. Finally, make sure to get enough rest and relaxation. Stress can exacerbate fatigue, so it is important to take time for yourself.\n\nWith these lifestyle changes, you should be able to manage your anemia without the need for medications or injections. If you have any further questions",

The due date based on ultrasound is likely more accurate, so you should consider that your due date. \n\nThere are generally 12 to 14 \"safe\" days after a period, meaning that you are unlikely to get pregnant during this time.

This does not necessarily mean there is anything wrong with the baby, as some babies are smaller than average. However, it is advisable to keep an eye on the baby's development and consult your doctor if you notice any changes in the baby's movements or growth.",

The problem I have is that I have to try quite hard to speak in a normal tone, and I am extremely self-conscious about the way I sound.

It is possible that your septoplasty has caused an obstruction of your airway, leading to the vocal cord dysfunction.

I am more worried about the black spots. Rest she is absolutely fine. Please advice.\n\n### Response:It sounds like your daughter may have multiple papillomas, which are benign tumors of the tongue. The black spots are likely to be melanin, which is a pigment found in the skin and tongue. The redness of the tip of the tongue could be due to friction caused by her constantly touching it. It is possible that she is feeling the papillomas with her fingers when she touches her tongue.\n\nThe papillomas are usually harmless and often go away on their own, but it is best to have them checked by a doctor. The doctor may choose to do a biopsy to rule out any potential cancerous growth. In the meantime, it is best to avoid foods and drinks that irritate the tongue, such as spicy and acidic foods. Additionally, she should avoid scratching or rubbing her tongue, as this can cause irritation and bleeding.",

It is important to protect your skin from the sun's harmful rays, especially in the summer months.

The higher the SPF, the more effective it will be in blocking out the sun's rays. It is also important to reapply the cream every two hours, or after swimming or sweating.",

A follow-up lab test to check for signs of inflammation, such as C-reactive protein and sedimentation rate, should be done. If the results of these tests are abnormal, further investigation into the cause of the inflammation should be done.

Withdrawal bleeds can occur when the cervix is stimulated, and they are usually much lighter and shorter than a regular period. It is possible that the cramping you experienced was related to the withdrawal bleed. It is also possible that you are pregnant, so it is important to take a pregnancy test to be sure.",

Monocytes are a type of white blood cell that help fight infection, so a low count could indicate an infection or inflammation in the body. An elevated ESR could also indicate inflammation or tissue damage somewhere in the body. It is best to consult a doctor for further evaluation and treatment.",

It is important to be aware that it may take up to 4-6 weeks before you notice the full benefits of the medication. It is also important to be aware of the potential side effects of the medication, which can include nausea, dizziness, headache, and sexual dysfunction.

While in hospital, she contracted C.diff and has had several recurring bouts with it. She has had a transplant and so far she is doing well with no recurrence. She also has a fistula near the rectum from an abscess. They put in a tube to keep it open and flowing. She has always had bouts of constipation and diarrhea for years before the accident. Her cognitive functions have been diminishing. One of my brothers is living with her and care taking her for full time.She is very weak, but can walk with the aid of a walker. Before the accident, she was fine. But, she may have shown a few signs of slight memory issues and balance prior to the accident as well. Our main issue right now is loose stools with some fecal incontinence. The doctor said that the fecal incontinence is because of a weak rectum that will not hold back fecal matter. Also, the fistula is always draining. When her stools are normal, she has good energy and cognitive function. When she has loose stools, she is very weak and can hardly stand or walk. Her cognitive function is a lot worse. She gets very confused about daily items and memory issues.We are looking for supplements to keep her regular and avoid the loose stool episodes. These are recurring every other week. Being so weak at the time of an episode, the toilet and the surrounding area get very filthy. She has little control and not able to clean herself properly. Her diet is pretty good. We are trying to keep dairy items away, limiting sugar and some carbohydrates as best as we can.We are giving her Metamucil when she has loose stools as well as some ammonium. This seems to have very limited success. She is on a blood pressure medicine as well as on Coumadin. So, we have to watch for interactions between everything. Regarding supplements, right now she is taking Alpha-GPC, Prevagen and multivitamins B for cognitive help, Fish oil, turmeric and Centrum multivitamins.Any help or suggestions to prevent the loose stools without creating constipation would be appreciated. I would also like to increase her core energy, so she will feel more like moving around. We have a physical therapist at once a week.",

Additionally, increasing her fluid intake may help her stools remain soft and easy to pass. \n\nIt's also possible that the loose stools are caused by a medication she's taking.

This form of eczema is caused by dry skin and can be aggravated by cold weather. It is usually treated with moisturizers, corticosteroid creams, and other topical medications.

There are several non-invasive techniques that can be used to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, such as topical anti-aging serums, facials, massages, and exercises. Retinol-A is a good choice for topical treatment, as well as vitamin E and C serums if they are high-quality and have not oxidized. Facial exercises may be helpful, but it is best to consult a professional to make sure they are done correctly. Getting facials regularly can help with anti-aging, but it is best to consult a professional to determine how often is best. Losing weight can help reduce facial sagging, but it is important not to lose too much fat as this can have a negative effect.

The doctor started me on Clomid 50 mg three times per week.Testosterone shot up to 900\\s but symptoms persisted although Cialis helped with erection quality, still low libido.

So, I stopped taking the Clomid in March this year and had my physical last week.The doctor says my testosterone is 570, A1c is 6.0 and everything else looks good. He says since I still have symptoms, that I have testosterone resistance. His analogy was; like diabetics, their bodies produce insulin but just does not know what to do with it.So, his treatment recommendation is TRT testosterone replacement therapy along with Clomid. I am hesitant because I feel this therapy is overused nowadays, and I feel pretty good except my libido.Sought a second opinion today from my urologist, he seemed disinterested in me doing that but said if I try a few injections it would not hurt me, then advised me to run this by an endocrinologist.So I guess in summary:Do you believe that testosterone resistance is a valid diagnosis?If I do try the TRT, can I stop after a few weeks or a few injections and get back to the way I am right now with no permanent issues?Should I just start the Clomid again, or just keep using the Cialis and keep working out and trying to clean up my diet more?Any other thoughts and advise would be appreciated.

Thanks.\n\n### Response:It sounds like you have been through a lot and have been very proactive in trying to address your symptoms. It is great that your testosterone levels have come up with the Clomid, but it is understandable that you are hesitant to continue with testosterone replacement therapy. It is true that testosterone replacement therapy is often overused, and it is important to make sure that any treatment decisions are based on an accurate diagnosis. \n\nIt sounds like your doctor is suggesting that you may have testosterone resistance, which means that your body is not responding to the testosterone that it is producing. This is a valid diagnosis, but it is important to get a second opinion from an endocrinologist to make sure. If it is confirmed that you have testosterone resistance, then testosterone replacement therapy may be the best option for you. It is possible to stop treatment after a few weeks or injections, but it is important to monitor your symptoms and testosterone levels closely. \n\nIt is also possible to try other treatments, such as Clomid, to see if your symptoms improve. It is important to keep working out and cleaning up your diet, as this can help improve your symptoms. It is also important to make sure that any medications you are taking are not interfering with your symptoms. Good luck!",

I took two painkillers and managed to sit there for a while, but after two to three hours the pain started radiating to leg. I was diagnosed with moderate disc herniation at L4-L5 and L5-S1. I was advised to take bed rest for three months and felt better after five months. Then I got some manipulation done with my lower back and my condition got worse. After that I had slight pain in my tail bone while walking and the pain got worse when I sit for five minutes. It got radiated to hips, thighs and it was worse when I stood up from a sitting position. Then I left with no option except bed rest for another four months that is a total nine months of bed rest. After that I suddenly started walking two to three hours a day in a stretch and started doing some exercises. After few days of getting my body too much into motion I felt my upper back getting stuck and again was unable to move and the pain radiated to my wrist and hand. Then had bed rest for another 10 days and felt a bit better. But, still in pain and resumed with two to three hours of brisk walking and exercises. I noticed that many joints in my body were making cracking sound while I walk or move my body and they were continuous. They are not going away no matter how much I move that joint, the cracking sound will repeat infinite times whenever I move my body. The cracking sound is mostly from lower and upper back, shoulder, ankle, foot fingers, knees also make that cracking sound and it is painful as well. Cracking sound in knees are felt more when I start walking after being in rest state and frequency of cracking sound reduces after walking for two to three minutes.I got my ESR and CRP checked. They are normal, but there is a slight increase in lymphocytes and RBC. Now, I have been suffering from this continuous cracking sounds and pain in almost all my joints for more than a month now. I also suffer from severe pain in tail bone area. Also suffers from some sensation loss (not persistent) in left side of my upper left leg, pain in groin area (but not anymore), pain in lower back and upper back. Also a few days back a physiotherapist did some manipulation, which again increased my problem and after that when I wake up in morning both my hands are badly at asleep. Doctors say that discs are hydrated and it is rather some other thing which is causing me problems but are unable to diagnose.

I am only 27 years old and unable to do simple tasks like sitting for five minutes. Please help me, what could be the possible reason for all this.I had some back pain three years ago. My lifestyle is also not good. I do not used to any exercise or walk earlier, only sitting on a chair in front of a computer for 10-11 hours. I have also gained weight of 15 kg in 10 months.

It is possible that the disc herniation at L4-L5 and L5-S1 is the cause of your current symptoms, but it is also possible that other factors are contributing. It is difficult to say without a full evaluation, but it is possible that the disc herniation has caused nerve compression, leading to the symptoms you are experiencing. It is also possible that the manipulation you have had done has caused further damage. It is also possible that the weight gain and lack of exercise are contributing factors. \n\nIt is important to get a full evaluation from a qualified medical professional to determine the cause of your symptoms and the best course of treatment. This may include physical therapy, chiropractic care, pain management, or other treatments. It is also important to make lifestyle changes such as exercising regularly, eating a healthy diet, and maintaining a healthy weight. Good luck!",

Cementum is softer than enamel and can wear down over time, resulting in the sharp edges that you can feel on your lower incisors. It is possible that the piece that broke off was a piece of cementum, which can range in color from white to yellow.

I just had to switch the other doctor because of insurance and my new doctor says old stress echos are irrelevant, that only chemical or nuclear echos work in patients with lbbb. Is this true? I have a strong family history of heart disease, my father survived two heart attacks, mother survived double bypass and my maternal uncle died from a heart attack, all were smokers with high cholesterol and high blood pressure. I am a former smoker. I am a 43-year-old female. I have been exercising six days per week for over 20 years. My cholesterol is high 213 but HDL is 140 and triglycerides are low.

I have been under the care of a cardiologist to make sure my heart is fine since then. I have done stress echos yearly or every two years since and have been told my heart is otherwise fine. I just had to switch the other doctor because of insurance and my new doctor says old stress echos are irrelevant, that only chemical or nuclear echos work in patients with lbbb. Is this true? I have a strong family history of heart disease, my father survived two heart attacks, mother survived double bypass and my maternal uncle died from a heart attack, all were smokers with high cholesterol and high blood pressure. I am a former smoker. I am a 43-year-old female. I have been exercising six days per week for over 20 years. My cholesterol is high 213 but HDL is 140 and triglycerides are low. I am a little put off by a nuclear stress echo and would prefer the regular exercise. But I want to know what this new doctor says is true? Then I guess I will have to go nuclear.

Doctor did not mention anything other than lbbb that was previously diagnosed.\n\n### Response:It is true that nuclear stress echocardiograms are more accurate than regular stress echocardiograms in patients with LBBB. However, it is also important to note that chemical stress echocardiograms can be used in some cases. It is also important to consider the patient's risk factors, such as family history of heart disease, when evaluating the need for a nuclear stress echo. It is also important to monitor your cholesterol levels, as well as your blood pressure, as these can increase your risk of heart disease. It is best to discuss your options with your doctor and decide together what the best course of action is.",

Women over 40 are at higher risk of developing complications such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and gestational diabetes. They are also at higher risk of having a baby with chromosomal abnormalities and birth defects.

The white coating on the tongue and malaise are common symptoms. The fever, vomiting, and swollen lymph nodes also suggest that there may be an infection present. It is possible that the antibiotics you are currently taking are not effective against the bacteria causing the infection.

The active ingredient in Delsym 12 hour cough is dextromethorphan, which can cause dizziness, drowsiness, and blurred vision. It can also interact with other medications, such as Vyvanse and Wellbutrin.

I am not married or pregnant.Recently, I have been having a problem of breast leakage and during intercourse, my boyfriend has also shared the same concern.It is embarrassing & alarming at the same time.

This can be due to hormonal changes, such as those that occur during pregnancy and puberty, or it can be the result of a medical condition, such as a benign proliferative breast disorder. It can also be caused by trauma or injury to the breast.\n\nIt is possible that the leakage could be related to intercourse if the penetration is very deep or the movement is very vigorous.

Currently, I am taking Tranexamic acid, Cipramil, Valdoxan.\n\n### Response:It is unlikely that the use of stem cell creams will worsen your melasma. Stem cell creams are believed to reduce the appearance of pigmentation by increasing cell turnover and encouraging the production of collagen. However, it is possible that the use of stem cell creams could irritate the skin and make the melasma worse, so it is important to use caution and only use products that have been tested and are known to be safe.

About seven months ago, he had an episode of foreign body pain in the eye which the contact lens could not control. His optometrist changed the type of lens after remarking that the lens appeared tight. Although the painful sensations have decreased, they are still present with more of a sore feeling now. His ophthalmologist suggested that he discontinue the Azopt drops he had been using in case the preservative was causing some corneal toxicity. His eye pressure without the drops has read at 18 and 20 on separate occasions, but he does have corneal edema which may affect the measurement. He has had high pressure in that eye previously, but it was mostly lowered by Cyclodiode treatment some eight years ago. The consultant said he had left him on the Azopt drops just as a precaution. My query is that if the bandage lens has worked so well for pain management for 10 years is it possible that it can continue to work? And if the Azopt drops and their preservative had caused some toxic reaction seven months ago, could that still be causing him to feel the discomfort? His consultant suggested out that he could have the eye removed to control the pain, but as he has what he feels is some slight, useful vision in that eye, he does not want to take such a drastic and life-changing step. In fact, he wants to pursue the least invasive course of action to relieve the pain he is getting. I would appreciate any advice you could give as he is in quite a bit of pain.",

I have gone for X-ray, etc., and everything was fine.\n\n### Response:Based on the patient's description, it is likely that she is suffering from a seasonal allergic cough. This type of cough is often associated with changes in season and is usually triggered by allergens such as pollen, dust mites, and animal dander. It is likely that the patient has already taken medication to provide some relief, but a more long-term solution may involve identifying and avoiding the allergens that trigger the cough. She should also consider taking antihistamines and/or decongestants to reduce the symptoms. If the symptoms persist, she should consult a doctor for further advice and treatment.",

It is difficult to say without further information, so I recommend following up with your doctor and having them run additional tests to get to the root of the issue. It is possible that the antibiotics your doctor prescribed are appropriate, but it is also possible that they may need to be changed or another treatment may be necessary. As for cancer, it is always a concern when WBC counts are elevated, but it is too soon to jump to conclusions. I would recommend following up with your doctor and having them run the necessary tests to get to the bottom of the issue.",

Hoarseness can be caused by a number of things, including infections, vocal cord nodules, and cancer. However, in young children, the most common cause is crying. Cancer of the larynx is very rare in children, and typically presents with other symptoms such as difficulty breathing, swallowing, or speaking, or a persistent cough. If your daughter continues to have a hoarse voice, it is best to have her evaluated by a doctor to make sure there is no underlying cause. In the meantime, it is best to avoid giving her cold or sugary foods, and to make sure she is well hydrated.",

These symptoms are feeling compulsive looking in the smartphone, porn sites, and porn stars detail, and masturbate two to three times daily. Now, while looking on erotic porn stars videos, heartbeat and anxiety are high. Is it porn addiction? And what are the symptoms of porn addiction? Porn addiction and intense anxiety have any relation? Please answer me.\n\n### Response:It is possible that you are suffering from porn addiction, which is characterized by an inability to control the amount of time spent viewing pornography, intense cravings for pornography, and continued use despite knowledge of the negative consequences it causes. Porn addiction can lead to increased anxiety, so there is a relation between the two. It is best to consult a mental health professional for further evaluation and treatment.",

Quitting smoking is the best way to bring your levels back down and reduce your symptoms. It is also important to drink plenty of fluids and ensure you are getting enough iron in your diet. If the symptoms do not improve or if you are concerned about a possible miscarriage, you should consult a doctor.",

She is married for the last three years and seriously trying for conception from a year. She missed her period once in the beginning of this year. During her obstetrics consultation, beta hCG was done. It was repeated after two days. A transvaginal ultrasound scan was done and repeated after 10 days. The end result was diagnosed as a blighted ovum. So, it was evacuated by D and C.Our daughter is of normal build and nutrition. Her menstrual history was normal since the beginning in terms of cycle, duration, and flow. But, one month after D and C, she did not have her period. On the doctor's advice, she took some medicines and bleeding occurred. She was known hypothyroid. So, she was taking Thyroxin 50 or 75 to keep the TSH near about 2.5 Uiu/ml. Her Hb % and sugar are within the normal range.Again, she tried to conceive since three months ago along with Aspirin and folic acid. She missed her period last month. Her beta hCG was 9.20 mIu/ mL. It was repeated after two days. It came down to 1 Miu/ml suggestive of \\chemical pregnancy\\. This time, after a few days, a spontaneous jelly-like bleeding occurred for two days. I would like to add that her husband requires to take Penegra 50 mg tab before a performance. Our daughter is immunized with triple antigen, polio, MMR, chickenpox and hepatitis B vaccine in childhood. The transvaginal scan (done at a later phase of the first conception) showed normal anatomical and physiological pattern of the ovary and uterus to me at least (report attached).Two consecutive miscarriages brought great disappointment to all.

It is recommended that the patient and her husband undergo karyotyping to determine their respective chromosomal makeup. If any abnormalities are detected, further testing and treatment can be considered. In the meantime, the patient should continue to take the Aspirin, folic acid, and Vitamin B12 combination tablet and try to conceive. Additionally, lifestyle modifications such as reducing stress, exercising regularly, and maintaining a healthy diet can help improve the chances of a successful pregnancy.",

I am about to start 25 mg and work my way upto 80 mg over a few weeks. Strattera and Effexor both seem to inhibit Norepinephrine reuptake. Is it safe to take this combination?
